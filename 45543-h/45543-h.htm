<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pn">Very little is known for certain of one of
the most important events in the history of
the world, the coming of the Englishmen to
England. It took a long time, fully a
century, from 450 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> to 550 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, and they
came constantly, in small detachments for
the most part, landing on the coast, in all
directions, from the Forth to the Isle of Wight.
They came amidst the ruins of the mighty
Roman Empire, a new race of empire&ndash;founders,
with all the germs of a still mightier future.</p>

<p>The new&ndash;comers from the older Angeln or
England, now called Sleswig, came in the
greatest numbers. We know not why, but
it certainly was a wholesale movement. They
kept launching their small fleets of dragon
ships, and crossing the North Sea with their
gods, their door&ndash;posts, and their beautiful
golden&ndash;haired wives and children, until none
were left. They brought with them all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
deep religious feeling, all the imaginative
mythology, all the heroic tales of the old land.
They first disembarked on the coast between
the Forth and the Tees, driving back the
natives into Strathclyde, after a struggle
which lasted for many years. Among them
came Ida the son of Eoppa, with twelve sons,
in forty dragon ships full of English warriors.
He founded the castle of Bambrough on the
coast, which was at first surrounded with a
hedge and afterwards with a wall; and in
547 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> he became king of the country of
Bernicia, between the Forth and the Tees.
Ida was surnamed the "Flame&ndash;bearer." He
reigned for twelve years in Bernicia, when
Ethelric his son succeeded him.</p>

<p>Many more warriors landed on the coast
between the Tees and the Humber; and in
559 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> their Eolderman, named Ella, the son
of Iffi, the son of Wuscfrea, and twelfth in
descent from Woden, became king of the
more southern Northumbrian kingdom of
Deira.</p>

<p>When they were settled in their kingdom
of Deira, with Ella as their king, and Elfric his
brother as their leader in war, the sea&ndash;rovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
became farmers, ready to defend their possessions
and to fight for the acquisition of more
territory for their countrymen. They were
the ceorls or freemen assembling in communities
of families, within a boundary or
mark, and known by a common name with
the addition of the patronymic <i>ing</i>. The ceorl
owned a hide of land, bore arms, had a
vote, and took part in the <i>thing</i>, or general
assembly of his mark. The union of marks
formed a wapentake (Vopnatak), from the
custom of touching the chief's spear in token
of fealty. The union of Wapentakes formed
the Scire or Shire with its Shire&ndash;mót. The
Ceorl was the freeman, while the Eorl was the
nobleman or chief in peace and war, and the
Eolderman was a prince of the family of the
Cyning (from <i>cyne</i>, generous) or king, who
wore the <i>cynehelm</i> or circlet of gold.</p>

<p>The Englishmen came with their immemorial
gods, and their grand old traditions.
Woden was their All&ndash;father and Creator, Thor
the mighty enemy of giants and trolls, Tyr
the god of war. They invoked Balder the
bright and fair of aspect; Freyr, who presided
over rain and sunshine; Niord, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
ruled the winds; Ægir, god of the ocean; and
many more. "Our forefathers derived comfort
in affliction, support in difficulty, from
the belief that the gods watched over them.
They bent in gratitude for the blessings they
conferred, and were guided and directed in
the daily business of life by the conviction
of their responsibility to higher powers than
any which they recognised in the world
around them." A religious feeling was the
basis of their respect for law&mdash;of their loyalty,
of their free institutions, and of those customs
and habits of thought which were the foundation&ndash;stones
of the edifice of English liberty.
These old warriors brought with them to
their new homes all those germs which were
fertilised by their virtues, and watered with
the life&ndash;blood of their valour, until, in the
course of centuries, they grew up to form
the greatest nation this earth has ever seen,
a fruitful and beneficent tree, spreading its
branches far and wide round the world.</p>

<p>It was, in all probability, not Ella and
Elfric, nor their war&ndash;comrades Seomel and
Brand, Vidfinn and Guthlaf, who first crossed
the sea from Angeln; for it must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
taken two or three generations to establish
the English firmly in Northumbria, and
their grandfathers were the original invaders.
They found the country desolate, and for
the most part waste. The Roman roads
traversed the moors and forests, and formed
causeways over the swamps, but the stations
were abandoned and ruinous. There was
scarcely any cultivation. Vast tracts were
covered with forests, the haunts of wild
cattle and red&ndash;deer, of boars and badgers, of
wolves and wild&ndash;cats. It was in truth the
"<i>Deira</i>" or land of wild animals. The ponds
and marshes were frequented by myriads of
wild&ndash;fowl, and few had ever penetrated into
the hidden recesses of the wildernesses. By
very slow degrees, amidst wars and disturbance,
the English began to change the
whole face of the country. The first beginnings
were in the days of Ella and Elfric,
when defensible homesteads were built, land
was apportioned, and laws began to be obeyed.</p>

<p>On the death of Ella in 588 his son Edwin
fled before Ethelric King of Bernicia, who
conquered Deira, but, after the death of
Ethelric, Edwin took heart and not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
reconquered his own kingdom of Deira but
Bernicia also, and united them both in one
great kingdom of Northumbria.</p>

<p>The history of the early struggles into
existence of any of the peoples who, in later
centuries, have formed the nations of modern
Europe is unfortunately so obscure that it
can only furnish us with a mere general outline
of the course of events.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the record of a short
period is found, like an oasis in a desert, which
is full of most interesting details. The welcome
narrative abruptly begins, and as suddenly
ends, pleasing the reader with anecdotes,
speeches, estimates of character, and other
precious materials for history. There is a
very remarkable example of this in Bede's
invaluable work. Nothing can be more tantalising
than the extremely meagre character
of the accounts that have been preserved of
the leaders of the people, the makers of
England, as Mr. Green called them, during
the Heptarchy, the all&ndash;important period when
England was made. But there is one striking
exception. When the venerable monk of
Jarrow reaches the period of Edwin of Northumbria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
his narrative somehow has fresh life
and vigour breathed into it, and the following
half&ndash;century receives the same welcome treatment.
We see real progress being made in
the civilisation of the country and the condition
of the people, which, though checked,
was not put a stop to even by the desolating
invasions of Penda and Cadwalla.</p>

<p>One eagerly looks for the causes both of
the increased life in Bede's narrative and of
this remarkable period of sudden progress.
The full details furnished for Edwin's history
are so exceptional that the circumstance was
discussed by Dr. Giles, the editor of Bohn's
edition of Bede. He considers it to be clear
that Bede must have had access to highly valuable
materials, for his details are too minute in
themselves and too accurately defined to have
been derived by him from tradition only.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the history of Edwin's
reign are, however, far more interesting than
any question relating to Bede's materials. We
find a man who had passed his life in exile, and
under every disadvantage, suddenly developing
into a most efficient ruler and giving vigour
and direction to every branch of his administration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
But this is not all. He is found
assuming ensigns of sovereignty, adopting
measures and undertaking expeditions of a
character not at all in accordance with what
could possibly be expected from a sovereign of
any state in the English Heptarchy of that
period.</p>

<p>There is one natural way of accounting for
the various problems connected with Edwin's
life&ndash;story, and especially with his reign. The
presence of a bigoted and very timid Roman
monk, like Paulinus, in attendance on his
Queen, will in no way explain them. Edwin
caused a chronicle of his labours to be written;
he assumed ensigns only known at the court
of the Emperor; he provided for the convenience
of travellers in a way only practised
in the East; he equipped a fleet for the subjugation
of distant islands; he established
order in a way so effectual that no organisation
known in the England of the seventh
century could have enforced it.</p>

<p>Edwin was a man of great ability, it must
be conceded, but this will not account for the
introduction of measures so at variance with
the ideas and habits of the governments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the Heptarchy at that time. One explanation
covers all the ground. It is quite possible that,
owing to a very extraordinary combination of
circumstances, certain countrymen of Edwin
may have had rare opportunities of visiting the
distant regions of the then known world, of
studying many things in many climes, and
that, after years of absence, they may have
returned home. Surrounded by such men as
his friends and ministers, the history of his
reign is made perfectly clear. A hint here
and there even enables us to guess who some
of these great men were. History, in that
age, usually gives us a mere skeleton. Bede,
fortunately, in the case of the illustrious
Northumbrian Bretwalda and his people, gives
us much more, but not nearly enough. Following
the venerable historian closely and
exactly, it is not an unworthy aspiration to
fill up the blanks, and to present these
workers in the making of England as living
and moving beings. Even we, at this distance
of time, may owe them something. All the
seeds that they scattered so perseveringly and
so earnestly, and with such loving care for
their country and its welfare, cannot have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
fallen among thorns or on rocky ground. It
is such considerations which have given rise
to this attempt to tell the strange and
romantic story of the Paladins of King Edwin
the Great.</p>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">STILLINGFLEET</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The sacred ash tree spread its wide leafy
branches over the court of the Stillingas. On
one side of this court was the long hall, built
of timber, with quaintly&ndash;carved joists and
gables, on two others were the barns and
cattle&ndash;sheds, the whole being surrounded by a
stiff quickset hedge concealing the view of
the open country. This ash was not only
sacred from its size and antiquity, and as an
emblem of the ash tree of <i>Yggdrasil</i>, but it
also had an elf hole through which children
could be passed, a peculiarity possessed by no
other ash for miles around. Six children were
dancing joyously round the tree one bright
summer afternoon 1300 years ago, and making
the whole place resound with merry laughter.
The eldest was twelve years of age, a sturdy,
straight&ndash;limbed boy named Coelred, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
eldest son of Seomel, the warrior chief of
the Stillingas. He had blue eyes and a sunburnt
little face, with masses of brown hair
falling over his shoulders. His brother
Porlor, two years his junior, was a bright
child with a dreamy, thoughtful look in his
eyes when at rest, and a strong little frame
fit for sustained work even at that early age.
Their companion, Hereric, numbering the
same years as Porlor, was an inch taller, and
his hair was golden and glistened as the sun's
rays rested on it. He was a young prince,
son of the warrior Elfric, the brother of
Ella the king of Deira. His little brother
Osric was only three years of age. The
four boys had two girls for playfellows&mdash;Bergliot,
the golden&ndash;haired princess, aged
six years, and Braga, or Bragaswith, the
little sister of Coelred and Porlor. Ella, the
king, lived at Aldby with his queen and his
daughter, the princess Alca, aged sixteen, and
the new&ndash;born prince Edwin, the hope of Deira.
Elfric was established at the Aldwark, the
remains of the imperial palace within the
walls of Eburacum, or Eoforwic (York), as the
English then called it. But he was a widower,
and his children were generally at Stillingfleet,
under the care of the gentle wife of Seomel,
the British lady Volisia. Elfric himself was
also a frequent visitor, to consult with Seomel,
his friend and companion in arms, over the
affairs of the frontier.</p><br />

      </p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On that bright summer afternoon the Lady
Volisia sat on a bench by the carved door&ndash;post
of the hall, her baby&ndash;girl Nanna asleep by
her side. She was tall and slim, with a
slightly aquiline nose and soft brown eyes.
She watched the happy group round the ash
tree, a gentle smile lighting up her face as she
bent again over her work. It consisted of a
bright&ndash;coloured scarf to which she was attaching
tassels. Presently the children left off
dancing and began passing each other through
the elf hole. It was said to bring luck, but it
was too rough a game for the little ones, so
the lady called the children to come round
her, and told them that they should play the
chance game for the scarf. This was one of the
most ancient of all Teutonic games. Every
child held the edge of the scarf with both
hands. One was chosen to say a well&ndash;known
spell, touching a hand at each word, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hand on which the last word fell was dropped
out. The spell was then repeated as often as
necessary, and the owner of the last hand left
won the game. Twelve small hands held the
scarf, and the Princess Bergliot said the spell.</p>

<p>Thus it ran:</p>

<table id="tab" summary="Spell.">

 <tr>
  <td><i>Hurli Burli</i></td><td><i>Scipa Hwede</i></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td><i>Blypan Trothorn</i></td><td><i>Gang Feran</i></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td><i>Eastor Gasta</i></td><td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ut.</i></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">The final "<i>ut</i>" came to Hereric the
Atheling, but he presented the scarf, with all
the ardour of a lover of ten years old, to his
little playmate Braga. At the moment that
the happy and smiling child received it, a horn
was heard in the distance, and all ran at full
speed to the gateway left in the line of the
defensive hedge. Coelred, the eldest, was
allowed to rush on, but the rest were called
back by Volisia to await the arrivals within
the courtyard.</p>

<p>The view outside the surrounding hedge
showed that the home of Seomel, the chief of
the Stillingas, stood on the edge of a ridge
running east and west, with a stream flowing
through the valley below. The homesteads of
the Stillingas, each with some tillage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
pasturage round it, were built at intervals on
either side of the stream, just clear of the
highest flood. But beyond the narrow valley
the whole landscape consisted of one dense
forest. The ridge was chiefly wooded with
ash trees, whence the name of Escrick (or
Ashridge) for its more eastern part, and a
short steep hill led down from the gateway of
the Stillingfleet to the margin of the brook.</p>

<p>Coelred ran down the hill, and his bare legs
and feet carried him through the water and up
the opposite side, just as the cavalcade emerged
from the forest. It consisted of Elfric the
Atheling; Seomel, the chief of the Stillingas;
Guthlaf, the chief of the Hemingas; the
Princess Alca, a young girl numbering sixteen
summers, with her women; the gleeman Coifi;
and a following of warriors returning from a
short campaign against their northern neighbours
of Bernicia. It is not certain whether
the ladies rode as is now the fashion. Some
people maintain that the Lady Wake, grandmother
of the Fair Maid of Kent, was the first
Englishwoman who used a side&ndash;saddle, 800
years afterwards. Others consider that the
question is unsettled. At all events, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Guthlaf took his leave and rode on to his more
distant home with his followers, and the Stillinga
folk made for their homesteads in the
valley, the rest cantered up the hill and dismounted
in the courtyard, where they were
warmly greeted by Volisia and the children.
Coelred ran like a young deer by his father's
horse, and it was his proud privilege to assist
the Lady Alca to dismount.</p>

<p>Elfric and Seomel were men of gigantic
proportions, tall, sinewy, and well knit, with
blonde beards and fair hair flowing over their
shoulders, and of the same height. They wore
over their linen tunics leathern shirts with iron
scales or rings sewn upon them in rows, over
which were metal collars. Their hose were
blue, cross&ndash;gartered from ankle to knee with
strips of leather, and their shoes had an opening
down the instep tied close with thongs.
On their left sides hung long single&ndash;edged
iron swords, with hilts wrought of silver and
bronze and scored with mystic runes, in
wooden scabbards tipped and edged with
bronze. Short daggers, called <i>seax</i>, were suspended
from their girdles on the right side.
The small round war&ndash;boards or shields, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
an iron boss, were slung over their backs, and
in their hands were the long ashen spears.
Their helmets were of leather bound with iron
and crested with iron&ndash;wrought figures of wild
boars with eyes of brass. Over their armoured
shirts they wore embroidered cloaks of blue
cloth, fastened on their shoulders with a golden
and jewelled buckle. Coifi, the gleeman, was
in less warlike guise. He wore a garment
with tight sleeves and embroidered breast, not
unlike a smock&ndash;frock, with a hood attached,
his feet and legs being cross&ndash;gartered, while a
small harp was suspended round his neck and
hung at his left side.</p>

<p>The return from a warlike expedition was
usually the occasion for a feast in the hall of
the chief. It was so in this instance. As the
sun went down Alca and the children retired
to rest in the inner rooms, while the servants
prepared the meal. In the centre of the long
hall was the hearth&ndash;fire, with a hole in the roof
for smoke; but now it was covered with green
boughs, and on either side of it the boards
were fixed on trestles. The freemen, or <i>ceorls</i>,
of the Stillingas and of the Atheling almost
filled the great room, seated in rows on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
benches or settles, while the Prince and
Seomel, with his wife, took their places at
the head of the upper board. Our English
ancestors were very clean, the use of baths was
general, and before the Stillingas sat down to
meat water was brought them for hands and feet.
The fare was good and plentiful, meat being
handed round on spits, while the horns were
filled with ale, and the warriors talked in groups
over the events of the campaign. But it was
not until the Lady Volisia had herself handed
round the brimming mead&ndash;cups to her guests
and had retired, that the harp and song were
called for. Then all eyes turned to the famous
gleeman who had arrived in the Atheling's train
from York. No man in the kingdom came near
him for depth of knowledge of the ancient
religion or of the folk&ndash;lore of the English. He
stood by the chiefs at the upper end of the hall
and tuned the harp as the mead&ndash;cup circulated.</p>

<p>Coifi sang that thrilling legend which never
failed to arouse the enthusiasm of his countrymen,
and which was peculiarly appropriate
after an expedition which had for its object
the rescue of a Deiran town from a Bernician
invasion. He told how the hero Beowulf came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to Heorot with a chosen band, to rescue the
subjects of King Hrothgar from the cruelties
of their fiendish enemy Grendel; how Beowulf,
single&ndash;handed, tore the monster's arm
from his shoulder; how he then overcame
Grendel's mother at the bottom of the sea
with the aid of the sword Hrunting; and how
he returned home victorious after this dread
encounter. The touches of nature in the descriptions
of scenery, the exciting speeches
and challenges, the warlike sentiments, went
right home to the hearts of his hearers, and
loud and long was the applause at the conclusion
of each fytte or canto, when the mead&ndash;cup
passed round, and Coifi paused for breath.</p>

<p class="pp1">And here the singer for his art<br />
Not all in vain may plead:</p>

<p class="pp2">The song that nerves a nation's heart<br />
Is in itself a deed.</p>

<p class="p1">At length the long but inspiriting song was
ended. Seomel and the Atheling retired, the
Stillingas went to their homes, while straw
was shaken down along the hall, behind the
mead&ndash;benches, as beds for the strangers. An
eventful day thus ended, and all was silence
in the courts of Seomel.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">ALCA</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Alca was the most beautiful girl that her
countrymen had ever beheld; and even then,
at the early age of sixteen years, as she tripped
out into the crowded court, she appeared to
the beholders to be a perfect dream of loveliness,
lithe and active, yet with the graceful
dignity of a long&ndash;descended princess. Her
hair was golden, her eyes a deep sapphire
blue, with that calm depth of meaning which
was then believed to be one attribute of an
elf&ndash;maiden. Alca, from a young child, had
been remarkable for the universality of her
love, which was extended to all the gods had
made. Her wisdom and knowledge were far
beyond her years, and seemed to those around
her to be miraculous. She saw the true meanings
of beliefs and customs. She alone was
able to extract the hidden truth from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
mysteries of nature, and could understand
those longings and aspirations which her companions
could only dimly shadow forth by
their creeds and their superstitions. All loved
the Princess, but they looked upon her as one
nearer to gods than to men; and only children
dared to love her without awe, and as a being
higher and wiser, but still one of themselves.
For the rest of the world Alca was an elf&ndash;maiden
endowed with special gifts by the
gods.</p>

<p>The Princess had accompanied her uncle
to Stillingfleet to see her cousins and other
young friends, and to visit the Lady Volisia,
to whom she was warmly attached. On
that summer morning she was to go with
her friend to the shrine of a goddess of her
people on the other side of the Ouse, attended
by the children and by several servants.
When they reached the bank it was high tide.
A large flat&ndash;bottomed boat was run into the
water, and the party was pulled across by the
boys to an old Roman fort on the opposite
side, called Acaster. It consisted of two
towers, like those on the column of Trajan,
surrounded by a ditch. It was on the verge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of a dense forest, in which some clearings had
been made. The whole tract forming the
angle between the Ouse and Wharfe was
forest&ndash;clad, except where clearings had been
made for planting apple and other fruit trees,
and where the <i>ings</i> or swampy meadows
formed a fringe between the forest and the
river banks. The pilgrims made their way
through the thickets by a very narrow path
without stopping, for the promised visit to
the orchards was to be on their return, after
their devotions had been duly paid to the
goddess.</p>

<p>Nehalennia, to whose worship the wife of
Seomel had remained faithful, was a Celtic
goddess, who presided over fertility, and
especially over fruit trees, and who was also
the goddess of chalk pits and the patroness
of chalk workers. The temple or <i>haruc</i>
(<i>Hörgr</i>), as the English called it, was unbuilt
by human hands. The deity dwelt in a
shady spot, embowered and shut in by self&ndash;grown
trees, veiling her form in the rustling
foliage of the overhanging boughs. Here, just
within the forest, but bordering on the bright
expanse of <i>ings</i>, stood a large slab of limestone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
on which was carved in relief an image
of Nehalennia, with long flowing hair, and
baskets full of apples by her side. Masses of
elecampane (<i>Inula Helenium</i>) and of other
medicinal plants grew round the base of the
carved stone, and a solemn silence reigned
around. A few rays of the mid&ndash;day sun
found their way through the overhanging
branches, and lighted up the bas&ndash;relief, carved
by some well&ndash;trained Roman hand. The Lady
Volisia, the Princess Alca, and the children
made their offerings to the shrine, and continued
kneeling in devotion for some time.
It was the very spot on which the Cistercian
nunnery of Appleton was erected 600 years
afterwards.</p>

<p>The party made their way through the
dense forest from the shrine of Nehalennia
to the orchards of Appleton, which supplied
Stillingfleet and all the homesteads round
York. Here they rested under the apple
trees, eating the rosy fruit, while Alca talked
to the children. Porlor had asked her
why Nehalennia was not also a goddess
of the English, and she answered in the
way which would make the essence of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
mysteries most clear to her companions.
"The names only are different," she said,
"the deity is the same. Your mother and
her people pray for fertility to Nehalennia,
and you and Coelred and your sisters should
do likewise, because invocation of the same
name is one more tie of love between mother
and children. Your father's people invoke
Freyr to send them rain and sunshine, and to
give them the fruits of the earth in due
season. But it is the same thing. Both are
names to denote the beneficent goodness of
the 'All&ndash;father,' he whom the English call
Woden. Remember that whatever god we
invoke, we are always praying, through one
of his attributes, to the 'All&ndash;father.'</p>

<p>"Woden has many names," she exclaimed
in a voice which awed her companions, and
with a rapt look, as if gazing through
space and seeing what was not visible to
them. "He is the God and Father of victory,
the Giver of gifts, the Almighty and
All&ndash;knowing, but always the Father and
Creator of gods and men. Sitting on his
throne <i>hlidskialf</i> he can survey the whole
world, and can hear all that goes on among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
men. His spear <i>gûnguir</i> is in his hand; his
ravens, <i>Huginn</i> and <i>Muninn</i>, are on his
shoulders; his wolves, <i>Geri</i> and <i>Freki</i>, are at
his feet; his horse <i>Sleipnir</i> by his side. He
too is the Father of the slain, and the
Rewarder of the brave and good when this
life is ended." After a pause her eyes lost
that far&ndash;away look, and were full of love as
she turned to the children, and promised to
tell them the meaning of all these things as
soon as they were old enough to understand.
Coelred, who had been eagerly listening to
all the Princess had said, now anxiously
inquired about the slain, and about the
fatherhood of Woden in regard to them. "In
three years," he said, "I shall be girded with
a sword, and shall take my place in battle by
the side of my father Seomel. How soon
after that will Woden choose me to be one
of the slain: are the bravest taken first, or
the youngest, or those who are of least
service? Can the Princess tell me?" Alca
replied, as they wended their way home&mdash;"Of
that hour it is given to none to tell.
Woden sends his wish&ndash;maidens, called Valkyrie,
who fly through the air to choose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
heroes that are to fall. Often the best and
bravest are taken, sometimes the very young,
sometimes a warrior waits long and fights in
many battles before his turn comes. No
good warrior fears the Valkyrie. They are
to be loved, not feared. They hover over the
conflicting armies, mingle in the ranks, take
the slain in their embraces, and ride with
them on their heavenly horses to Valhalla,
where they attend at the feasts, and hand
the drinking&ndash;horn to gods and heroes. But
touching the hour of death nothing can be
known, because the selection is made on the
spot by the Valkyrie. The time we cannot
know." Then she turned with a sweet smile,
and, looking from one to the other, she said
to the two boys, "Yet this I do know, for it
is given to me to know. When the fulness
of time arrives, Coelred and Porlor will fall
in battle, fighting bravely in a righteous
cause."</p>

<p>The boys were deeply impressed. Their
hearts were too full for words, and there was
silence until they reached the old Roman
tower at Acaster and had crossed the river.
It was broken by Porlor, who asked if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Valkyrie could be seen. "No," replied Alca,
"they are unseen in battle; for, like Woden
and the Valhalla, they are a mystery, which
it is given to few to understand." "But,"
persisted Porlor, "cannot they put on the
<i>alptahamir</i> (swan shifts), and take the form
of birds of augury? Our friend Oswith, the
son of Guthlaf, told us that he saw three
swans alight on Derwent bank, put their
white swan shifts in the grass, and turn into
beautiful maidens. They bathed in the river,
resumed their shifts, and flew away again as
swans; and Oswith never lies. Were they
Valkyrie?" Alca answered that "it was
given to some to behold these mysteries, and
to understand the truth that lies concealed
in them, but to others it was not given."
They were now approaching the gate of Stillingfleet
as the sun set, the faithful dog
Shuprak bounded out to meet them, and the
conversation turned to trivial subjects as
they entered the court.</p>

<p>Some days afterwards the three boys,
Hereric, Coelred, and Porlor, with their dog
Shuprak, set out for the burg of the Hemingas,
to join their friend Oswith, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Guthlaf, on a hunting expedition. They
wore cross&ndash;gartered hose, and belts with
metal buckles, from which long hunting&ndash;knives
were suspended; bows and arrows were slung
on their backs, and the little fellows also
carried short iron&ndash;headed spears. For several
miles they made their way through the dense
forest, until they emerged on Skipwith Common,
where the ruins of an abandoned town
of the Parisi, consisting of circular huts, still
showed many traces. It was a weird and
desolate place even in bright sunshine, and
Porlor whispered to his companions tales of
grey old wood&ndash;folk clothed in moss, of dwarfs
and giants, and of the lubber fiend, as they
hurried across the moor, and again plunged
into the forest. They went swiftly over the
ground, and soon reached the clearings and
the fortified burg of the Hemingas, at the
junction of the rivers Ouse and Derwent.
Here there was a ruined fort built by the
Romans, which had been repaired with timber,
and was the home of Guthlaf, the chief of
the Hemingas. His son Oswith was the
same age as Coelred, straight as a dart, broad&ndash;chested
and lean&ndash;flanked&mdash;a splendid specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of a young Englishman. He was a fast
friend of the sons of Seomel, and, after warm
words of welcome, their first act was to challenge
each other to fight. A wrestling&ndash;match
at once commenced on the green, and the
lithe and sinewy figures of Coelred and Oswith
were soon entwined, as they strove, with
every muscle at extreme tension, to throw
each other to the ground. Each boy won a
bout, which made them quite happy, and the
four lads, after a merry meal, set out on
their search for forest game, working northwards
again towards the home of Seomel.</p>

<p>"Nature was an open book to these lads
of the far&ndash;distant past. They lived in nearer
communion than we can do with the world
around them. Their frames, not yet clogged
and vitiated by the habits of an advanced
civilisation, were more alive than ours to the
external effects of natural causes. The birds
spoke to them, the forest whispered to them,
the wind wantoned with their curly locks,
they stood before the great spirit of nature
face to face, and knew him as he revealed
himself in every one of his divine
forms."  Loaded with as much game as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
could carry, after a very successful and very
happy day, they were walking in single file
through the tangled underwood, when Oswith,
their leader, saw the eyes of a huge wild&ndash;cat
glaring at him through the dense foliage. It
sprang up a tree, and in an instant he had
thrown down his burden and was after it,
with his long knife in his mouth. When, at
a considerable height, he was swinging himself
forward to attack his antagonist, which was at
bay, the bough broke and he fell heavily to
the ground. His comrades found him suffering
intense pain, unable to stand, and with
a very badly sprained ankle. Abandoning the
spoils of the chase, Coelred and Porlor began
to carry him, but they were still several miles
from Stillingfleet. Hereric ran forward for
help, and when it came the sturdy little
fellows had already carried their friend upwards
of three miles. Oswith was soon lying
on a heap of fresh straw in Seomel's hall. His
hose and shoes were removed, and it was found
that the ankle was much swollen, so that there
was every prospect of days and even weeks
elapsing before he would be able to walk.</p>

<p>As soon as Coelred had seen that everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
that was possible had been done for his friend,
he sought his mother's bower, and throwing
himself at the feet of Alca, he besought her to
show favour to the son of Guthlaf. "Indeed,"
replied the Princess, "I will do what I can for
my young friend Oswith." She went into the
hall, patted the boy's head, and spoke cheering
words to him, with her eyes fixed on his until
she thought her spell would work. Then she
removed the bandage, placed her hand very
gently on the swelling, and uttered it, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp3"><i>Ben zi Bena,<br />
Bluot zi Bluode,<br />
Lid zi Geliden,<br />
Sôse gelimida sin.<br />
Thu biguolen Wodin,<br />
So he wola coude,<br />
Sôse ben&ndash;renki,<br />
Sôse bluot&ndash;renki,<br />
Sôse lidere&ndash;renki.</i></p>

<p class="pn">Volisia stood by her side, ready to administer
a sleeping&ndash;draught, and next morning Oswith
was quite healed, and able to walk and run as
well as ever. As soon as she saw that the
spell was working, Alca went out to the ash
tree in the courtyard and prayed to the Æsir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
on her knees, several groups of people watching
her with awe. When she rose and looked
round, Coifi came forward with a low obeisance.
The gleeman was an adept in the Teutonic
religious beliefs, and was versed in all the tales
and traditions of the mythology of his people.
But he looked upon them solely from a practical
point of view. He received every supernatural
story literally. To him Woden and Thor were
the wooden images preserved at Godmundham,
and he sought for no further light. Alca, even
in extreme youth, was visionary in her religious
views. The All&ndash;father, as she understood
him, was everywhere and pervaded everything.
The gods and goddesses were his attributes, or
represented his intentions and designs, as she
had explained to the children on the day of
the pilgrimage to Nehalennia's shrine.</p>

<p>"The spell will not work, I fear, O daughter
of the King," said Coifi, who was then a man
between thirty and forty, and known in every
burg and hall as the best gleeman in Deira.
"The spell will work, Coifi," replied Alca in a
gentle voice. After a pause the gleeman said
almost in a whisper, "I know the spell of
Balder's horse that you used for young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Oswith. I think I know every spell, but they
will not work for me. I pray and sacrifice to
the gods, but they help me not. Let them
give me power and I can believe them. I
believe when I see." Alca looked at him and
said, "I am too young to teach so learned a
man as Coifi. But I can say why the spell
will work. The boy loved me and believed.
I love the gods and have faith, so the spell
will work." Coifi replied, "But I cannot
believe until I see the spell work. If the spell
works I believe." "That is the wrong way,
Coifi," said the Princess. "Believe and the
spell works; for it works by faith. Wait
until the spell works before you can believe,
and it will never work." Puzzled and angry,
Coifi declared that he would serve the gods
and pray to them for his lifetime, and they
must answer him and give him power; but
that to believe before they showed him their
mighty works was impossible. Alca shook her
head. She said no more, but she saw that
insight was not given to Coifi.</p>

<p>As she stood by the side of the gleeman,
with Coelred and Porlor watching her from the
hall entrance, and with many people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
courtyard, her aspect suddenly changed. She
assumed a listening attitude and then looked
upwards. "The Valkyrie pass through the
air," she cried. "I neither see nor hear," said
Coifi; "it cannot be." All gazed in amazement
for several minutes. "A great battle is
joined. The heroes fall," was the next exclamation
of the Princess. She stood like one inspired.
"Coelred! Coelred! run to my eame the
Atheling and to your father; tell them to arm
and to assemble all their forces, for the enemy
approaches. Coifi, go thou to alarm the people.
Bid them to assemble armed and ready to
march." Coelred was off like an arrow from a
bow. Coifi also obeyed. The alarm&ndash;horns
were heard in the valley. In half an hour the
Stillingas were drawn up fully armed outside
the hedge. Elfric and Seomel, also fully
armed, had entered the enclosure and asked
eagerly for the cause of the alarm. Alca was
still standing under the ash tree. All eyes
were turned on her. The setting sun threw a
glow of light over her form. "I hear the
rapid feet of the messenger," she said, raising
one arm. "You will hear him and act quickly.
He comes&mdash;make way for him." A lane was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
formed, and between the two lines of warriors
a little boy ran breathless into the court, and
sank exhausted on the ground. "It is Forthere,
the son of Brand of Ulfskelf," exclaimed Seomel.
"Speak, boy! speak quickly&mdash;what are your
tidings."</p>

<p>The gallant little fellow had swum across
the river. As soon as he recovered breath he
delivered his message. The settlement at
Bilbrough had been suddenly attacked and
taken by an overwhelming force of Britons
from Elmet, led by their king Certicus. After
a short fight the slaughter began. Vidfinn,
the chief of the Billingas, was slain, and most
of his people were massacred. Neither age
nor sex was spared. A young woman with
little Sivel, the child of Vidfinn, brought the
news to Ulfskelf. But there was scarcely
breathing&ndash;time before the enemy appeared,
their numbers vastly increased; Ulfskelf was
surrounded, and Brand resolved to defend it to
the last gasp. A desperate fight took place
outside, but the overwhelming numbers of the
enemy soon obliged him to retreat behind his
palisades. Forthere had escaped by creeping
along the margin of the Wharfe. He then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
swam across the Ouse, and so brought the
tidings to Stillingfleet.</p>

<p>Elfric and his leading men assembled under
the ash tree and issued orders. It was a
bright moonlight night. A party had already
been sent off to prepare the boats for crossing
the Ouse. Mounted messengers were despatched
to Cuthred, chief of the Poclingas
beyond the Derwent, to Sigfrid of the Elfingas,
to Guthlaf of the Hemingas, to Ingeld of the
Heslingas, calling upon them to march with
all despatch and meet Elfric the Atheling at
Acaster. The first object was to save Ulfskelf,
if Brand could hold out so long. Elfric was
despatching another messenger to the King,
who was at Aldby, with a similar request.
But Alca spoke once more. She advised that
King Ella should be asked to cross the Ouse
with his fighting men, above York, advance
along the high land by the hill of Severus and
the ridge of Askham, and so take the enemy
in flank; while Elfric with his levies, raised
between Ouse and Derwent, opposed their
further advance.</p>

<p>Stillingfleet was no longer safe. It was
arranged that next morning the Princess Alca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and the Lady Volisia, escorted by Coifi and the
boys, with a few attendants, should take refuge
at Aldby. Meanwhile Elfric and Seomel, with
the Stillingas and the Atheling's own followers,
crossed the Ouse and began to entrench themselves
at Acaster in the early hours of the
night. When the reinforcements arrived next
day, they would boldly advance to the relief of
Ulfskelf.</p>

<div class="break">

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">ALDBY</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The escort of the Princess, of Volisia, and the
children left Stillingfleet next morning. In
the van rode the older boys, Oswith, Coelred,
and Forthere, all three well armed, followed by
the two ladies, the children, and attendants,
while Coifi, with the two younger boys, Porlor
and Hereric, brought up the rear. "The
gleeman is to be a priest of Woden," said Porlor
to his friend, "to whom it is not permitted to
carry arms. The defence of the rear depends
upon us, so we must be on our guard." All the
lads had arms suited to their size, but none of
them were yet old enough to wear swords.</p>

<p>After a mile's ride through the forest, they
came to open moorland where there was an
outlying stockaded post of the Stillingas,
afterwards called Moreby; and here they met
the Heslingas, led by the veteran Ingeld, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
whom the Princess gave fuller information
than had been brought by the messenger, and
he pushed rapidly onwards with his men, to
join the Atheling. Riding on over moor and
through forest, the ladies and their escort,
after some hours, reached the banks of the
bright river Derwent, where tall ash trees
threw shadows over its surface, which was
skimmed by water&ndash;hens, while now and then
the brilliant plumage of the kingfisher glistened
under the sun's rays as it darted to its galleried
nest in the bank. Soon the party came in
sight of Aldby, the royal seat of the kings of
Deira, on a slight eminence above the right
bank of the river, the buildings appearing
amongst clumps of tall trees.</p>

<p>The Roman station of Derventio, on the
Derwent, was twelve miles east of York.
When the English arrived, the buildings had
been much injured by invaders from the
north, and by more than a century of neglect.
They were in a ruinous condition, but they
were still standing; and they received the
name of Aldby, or the ancient town, from the
new&ndash;comers. The prætorium, repaired in
many places with timber, still had a portico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
composed of pillars with composite capitals,
and formed the guest&ndash;hall of the King of
Deira. A villa, consisting of rooms built round
three sides of a square, with corridors, and a
temple, were also included in the Deiran
palace. The walls of the guest&ndash;hall were
adorned with tapestry representing mythical
beings from the Teutonic mythology, and the
floor retained its mosaic pavement. Although
the boards or tables were on movable trestles,
there were fixed sideboards, with bowls of
bronze highly gilt and of very elegant forms,
metal dishes, and horns, while a raised dais
with a throne at one end gave some appearance
of regal dignity to the spacious hall.</p>

<p>King Ella had marched away with a large
force, but its place had been taken by warriors
from Driffield and from Godmundham, and
Aldby still had the busy appearance of a royal
abode, with yards and halls crowded with
armed men, priests, and servants. The fugitives
were cordially received by Ella's queen,
the stepmother of the Princess Alca, whose
name is not recorded in history. She had
recently given birth to a son, who had received
the name of Edwin, a child of destiny, round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
whose life&ndash;story the events of this narrative
will eventually centre. The children were all
eager to pay their respects to the young
Atheling, the hope of the house of Deira, and
Alca led them into the presence of the infant
prince.</p>

<p>There was much anxiety for several days,
but at last the news came that Elfric had
relieved Ulfskelf and defeated the numerous
but ill&ndash;disciplined army of Britons. Their
chief Certicus and his levies commenced a
retreat which the King converted into a rout
when he fell upon their right flank in the
swampy ground between Askham and Bilbrough.
Ella and his brother then formed a
junction round the hill, now called Ingrish,
and again fell furiously upon the disorganised
rabble. Certicus, with a small following,
escaped into the forests of Elmet, but there
was tremendous slaughter, and the place is
called Helagh to this day. The English
outposts were again extended to the old
Roman station of Calcaria, on the south side of
the river Wharfe, facing the ford of Nehalennia.
The King also restored the burg of
the Billingas, and all due honours were paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to the remains of the chief Vidfinn, who had
been a daring Viking before he established
himself at Bilbrough with his children Hjuk
and Bil. Nine votive boats of pure gold
were deposited in his grave, and a lofty
tumulus was raised above it, on the slope of
the red sandstone hill which rises gradually
from the Roman road between York and
Tadcaster. Little Sivel, the only surviving
child of Vidfinn, was adopted by Brand of Ulfskelf.
A nephew of Vidfinn, named Saebald,
surnamed Fairfax from his silver&ndash;white hair,
was elected to command the Billingas and to
defend the restored settlement of Bilbrough.</p>

<p>These administrative arrangements occupied
some time, during which the lads at Aldby
hunted in the forests between the Derwent
and the foot of the Wolds, sometimes pursuing
their game far into the chalky hills, and often
ascending Garraby, which rises to a height of
nearly 800 feet above Aldby. Their evenings
were passed in games with their sisters, or in
conversations with Alca, varied by listening to
the wondrous tales of Coifi or to the folk&ndash;lore
of another race preserved in the memory of
their mother Volisia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the five boys went with Coifi to
Godmundham to visit the temple which contains
the sacred images brought from the old
home on the continent. A space was encircled
by a quickset hedge, and within there
were three lofty elms, under which the idols
were set up. Hard by were the ruins of the
Roman station of Delgovitia, some of the
buildings having been roughly repaired to
serve as dwellings for priests and servants.
Coifi localised his beliefs. According to his
creed, Woden and Thor were within this enclosure
at Godmundham, or at all events
he held that this was their favourite home,
where worshippers must seek their help, and
where priests must observe all the ceremonies
connected with their cult. He told the boys
the history of the creation, and all the strange
legends which had gathered round it; and he
narrated the myth of Balder's death and of
Freyr's love for Gerdr. He attended the
sacrifices of bullocks, and remained long at his
devotions. But he never could derive either
power or inspiration from his prayers to the
gods, and he rose from them with an expression
of discontent and impatience. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
boys were glad to return to Aldby, dissatisfied
also, and eager for some more sympathetic
teaching. This they found in the Princess
Alca, who to them was the type of perfect
beauty and goodness.</p><br />

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">They had attended her on an excursion to
the foot of the Wolds, and rested on a rising
ground under the spreading branches of a tall
ash tree, with Aldby in sight beyond the river,
and a mass of waving foliage at their feet.
The sun was still high, the stillness only
broken by the songs of birds. Alca sat on
one of the projecting roots. The boys were
lying down at her feet, surrounded by leaves
and flowers, which they had been collecting
to decorate her bower. Porlor broke
the silence by asking the Princess to teach
them the story of Balder, and its meaning.
"Porlor," she said, "was right to be the
spokesman, for his name should make him a
student of Balder's lore. But I see by your
eyes," she added, "that you all wish me to
talk to you of the Son of God. Listen, then,
to one who seeks, though with little help and
in twilight, to learn and to show to others the
true meaning of hidden mysteries. Balder
was the son of the All&ndash;father, of the Creator
of gods and men. He was the god of light,
and grace, and manly beauty. His brow was
white as the chamomile flower. Through
him deeds of true bravery were done on the
earth, the weak were protected, virtue was
practised, and justice was maintained. But a
prophecy that Balder would perish afflicted
the gods. Then Frigga, the spouse of Woden,
took an oath from all created nature that no
individual thing would harm the pride of
Asgard, the beloved of gods and men. But
the goddess made a fatal omission. She
forgot a sprig of mistletoe. Being invulnerable,
Balder allowed the gods to use him as
a target. Now Loki, as you know, was born
among the yotuns. He was false and full of
wickedness, father of the terrible wolf Fenris
and of Hela, ruler of the dead. Loki put
mistletoe into the hands of the blind god Haudr,
and with this he slew the best and greatest of
Woden's sons, who descended into hell. The
All&ndash;father himself went down into the dark
abode of Hela, to persuade her to relinquish
her prey. She agreed, if all created nature
would weep for Balder. All nature did mourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
for the loss of the god of goodness and beauty,
save one old crone. 'What have the gods
done for me,' she said, 'that I should weep
for Balder? Let Hela keep her dead.' Thus
Balder's fate was sealed, and with it the fate
of the world; for justice, mercy, virtue, and
true bravery ceased to prevail with Balder's
death, though they did not entirely cease to
exist. I know not why the All&ndash;father, in
his wisdom, has submitted to this evil. But
it can only be for a time. The Son of God
will rise again in triumph. I sometimes think
that he has risen, though as yet we know
it not." Then the far&ndash;off look came again
into Alca's blue eyes, and during the rest of
her speech she gazed into the heavens. The
boys listened almost breathless.</p>

<p>"I think that God has risen to redeem
the world," she resumed. "I am impelled to
this belief, though I know not why, or by
what guiding power. But misfortune and
sorrow will not end&mdash;not yet. Coelred,
Hereric, Oswith, Forthere, Porlor, I love you
as very dear brothers. It is perhaps by
reason of my love that insight is given to
me. There is borne into my mind a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that some great calamity is impending over
you all, and that it will fall upon you
together. In this there is a ray of comfort."
She paused, and Coelred said, "If misfortune
overtakes us, O Princess, we will strive to
meet it as Englishmen, as sons of our brave
fathers, ever victorious in battle!" "And,"
said Oswith, "in all our troubles we will ever remember
the goodness of our beloved Princess."
Forthere spoke words like those of Coelred,
which were echoed by the younger boys.</p>

<p>"Of that I am certain," continued Alca.
"You will quit yourselves like men&mdash;above
all, like Englishmen. If you are together in
your trials, Coelred will be your leader. The
fearless Oswith will be your support, and will
help to form your plans. Forthere, too, will
be a trusty friend. Porlor will be most shrewd
as an adviser, and his rede should be followed;
and my sweet cousin Hereric will enlighten
counsels by his imagination. O my boys!
remember that if sorrow comes, Alca is praying
for you and thinking of you. Always act
as if the Son of God had risen. Be brave.
Love one another. Love truth. Be just and
merciful. If you hear that God has truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
risen, then remember my words. Be true to
yourselves, and you will triumph in the end.
May the gods watch over you!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Alca rose and
turned homewards, surrounded by the boys
with their sweet burdens. Anxious to turn
their thoughts from the solemn and depressing
theme on which she had been led to dwell for
a time, by a force beyond her control, the
Princess sang them a merry song, and talked to
them of the return of their victorious fathers,
which was expected on the following day.
When the party reached Aldby all were chatting
and romping, and the boys turned into an
inner court to exercise themselves in feats of
strength.</p>

<p>Next day the King arrived. Ella was a
large man, like his brother, but he looked
much older, worn with illness, and his expression
was melancholy and somewhat stern.
Elfric rode by his side, Seomel, Guthlaf, Brand,
and the other chiefs followed, and there was a
goodly array of English warriors. They dismounted
at the Roman colonnade, and were
soon surrounded by wives and children. The
great feast that night in the old prætorium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was ordered and arranged like that of Seomel,
but on a much larger and more regal scale.
The Queen herself took round the mead&ndash;cup
to the guests, and when she retired
there were songs of victory, and the harp
was passed from one to another. One
warrior had recited the events of the campaign,
and received great applause. Another
told of the surprise of the Billingas by the
cruel and treacherous Certicus. Late in the
evening Coifi took the harp, and selected for
his song the warning of Hrothgar to Beowulf
on the frail tenure of human life. This choice
was resented by some of those present as being
intended to have reference to the King; but
Ella himself approved, and the gleeman continued
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp4">Soon will it be<br />
That sickness or the sword<br />
Shall part thee from power;<br />
Or clutch of fire,<br />
Or wave of flood,<br />
Or gripe of sword,<br />
Or javelin's flight,<br />
Or ugly age,<br />
Or glance of eye<br />
Shall oppress and darken thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn">This melancholy dirge concluded the feast, and
before another year had passed King Ella was
in his grave.</p>

<p>The time of parting came only too soon.
The Lady Volisia, with her daughters and the
children of Elfric, returned to Stillingfleet.
The Atheling himself, with Seomel, proceeded
to York to make further preparations for
strengthening the frontier posts, and it was
arranged that Seomel should go thence, with
supplies of weapons and stores, to Bilbrough,
Calcaria, and Ulfskelf, before returning home.
He was to take a large escort of Stillingas,
and, to their great joy, the three elder boys
and Porlor were to accompany him.</p>

<p>The Atheling and those who were to go
with him to York took leave of the King
and Queen. But when the boys came to
say farewell to the Princess Alca their hearts
were too full for words, and tears were in
their eyes. They loved and worshipped her,
they would all have died for her, but not a
word could they say. She spoke very gently
and calmly, repeating what she had said yesterday.
"Remember my words. Be true to
yourselves, and may the gods watch over you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>After the cavalcade started, the boys looked
back again and again, waving their caps, until
the graceful form under the colonnade was lost
to sight. When would they see her again?
Ah, when!</p>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">YORK AND THE DEIRAN FRONTIER</span></p>

<p class="pn p2"><i>Aberach</i>, the British mound by the confluence
of Ouse and Foss, was converted into the Roman
camp of <i>Eburacum</i> by Agricola in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 79, and
from a camp became an imperial city, and the
headquarters of the 6th Legion for nearly
three centuries. The camp was surrounded by
a ditch 9 feet deep and 32 wide, with an <i>agger</i>
or rampart fortified by <i>valli</i>. The sides were
692 yards long, with four gates, and there was
a space of about a hundred yards between
the ditch and the river Ouse. But in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 120
the Emperor Hadrian caused the <i>valli</i> to
be replaced by substantial walls of alternate
layers of bricks and masonry, with towers
at the angles. The multangular tower at the
north&ndash;west is still standing. The prætorium
was converted into an imperial palace, and
stood on the ground now occupied by gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on the south&ndash;east side of Goodramgate, and by
Aldwark and Peterna. A temple of Bellona
stood on the site of part of St. Mary's Abbey and
the manor. Hyeronimianus of the 6th Legion
had dedicated a temple to Serapis on the site
of Fryar's Garden, and there was an artificial
cave for the worship of Mithras on a site in
Micklegate, opposite St. Martin's Church.
The sites of other temples and theatres,
which must have existed, are now unknown.
The dense forest of Galtres came close up
to the Prætorian gate, whence a road led
to Isurium, and the Decumanian gate was
in the centre of the opposite wall.</p>

<p>When the English arrived the 6th Legion
had been gone for upwards of a century and a
half, the place had been frequently pillaged,
the walls were broken down in several places,
and the beautiful Roman edifices were in
ruins. King Ella had repaired the breaches
in the walls with strong palisades, and his
brother Elfric had made a portion of the
imperial palace habitable.</p>

<p>Seomel and the four boys were the guests
of the Atheling for a few days, while weapons
were collected and got ready for the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the outposts beyond the Wharfe. The boys
wandered about among the ruins, and gazed
upon the porticoes and colonnades with awe
and admiration. It was then that they first
heard of the great emperors of Rome and of
the Legions, and they understood dimly that
their own people were only beginning to build
up a new empire on the ruins of a glorious past.
One day they had crossed the river Ouse to
see the tombs which lined both sides of the
Roman road leading to the south. Many
were broken down, but some were still standing,
especially on the higher ground. There
was a beautiful monument on the Mount,
where a youth and a maiden had been
buried, for their figures were carved in relief
on the stone, but of course the boys could
not read the inscription. Here they rested,
gazing over the swampy expanse of Knavesmire,
and Porlor fancied that the two figures
represented lovers who had been cut off in the
flower of their youth. They were worshippers
of Nehalennia; for a deity, like the one at
Appleton, was carved in the semicircular
space over their heads.</p>

<p>In running down the slope towards the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the boys stopped at the entrance of the cave of
Mithras, and entered with feelings of curiosity
mingled with awe. In the dim light they could
see a bull on its knees, and a young man plunging
a knife into its neck. "What can it mean?
Is it a priest sacrificing a bullock to Woden?"
said Oswith. "That cannot be," objected
Coelred, "for the images were not made by
our people, nor do we make images of the
sacrificers but of the gods, and those only
at Godmundham." Porlor sat long gazing at
the fine bas&ndash;relief, on which a few rays from
the sun cast a dim light. "The being with
a high cap," he said, "is a god, not a man. I
see by his face that he is a good god." His
companions looked again more closely. "The
god is plunging a knife into the bull, but it is
not to do harm but good, for he is a good
god." He again sat thinking. "It is a
mystery," he said at last, "and we are too
ignorant to solve it." "Alca would understand,"
said the other boys. They walked
down to the river, and, crossing it, returned
to the "Aldwark," as the ruined palace was
then called.</p>

<p>Next day Seomel left York with a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of laden horses, and a strong force as an
escort. The four boys were with him. Again
they passed the mysterious cave of Mithras,
and the monument of the two lovers on the
Mount, as they wended their way southward
along the Roman road. These Roman roads
in Britain were so admirably constructed that,
although they had been neglected for more than
a century, they were still serviceable. The
mode of construction was as follows:&mdash;Two
parallel furrows were dug to mark the width,
and all loose earth was removed down to the
rock. The first layer for the road was called
the <i>pavimentum</i>. On it was laid a bed of
small squared stones called <i>statumen</i>. The
next layer consisted of a mass of small stones
broken to pieces and mixed with lime, called
<i>rudus</i> or <i>ruderatio</i>. The third layer, called
<i>nucleus</i>, was a mixture of lime, chalk, broken
tiles, all beaten together. On this was laid
the <i>summum dorsum</i> or pavement of stones,
sometimes like our paving&ndash;stones, but oftener
of square flagstones. At proper intervals
there were stations for changing horses, called
<i>mutationes</i>, supplied with horses and <i>veredarii</i>
or postilions, and in charge of stationmasters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
called <i>statores</i>. The <i>miliaria</i> or milestones
were perfect stone cylinders about 3&frac12; feet
high, on bases.</p>

<p>The arrangements for travelling were out
of gear, and most of the <i>mutationes</i> were in
ruins or had been destroyed when King Ella
reigned. But the splendid road was so admirably
constructed that it was still efficient.
Seomel had been delayed, and had not started
until nearly sunset, but he made the best of
his way, and reached the dwelling of Saebald
the Fairfax, chief of the Billingas, long before
dark. Here the night was to be passed. It
was here that Saebald's predecessor had dwelt,
and here the old warrior had been surprised
by the Britons and killed. The place is now
called Street Houses. The house was one of
the <i>mutationes</i> of the Roman road, to which
some wooden buildings had been added. But
it was exposed, and it was the intention of
Saebald to remove his people to a stockaded
burg on the summit of what was afterwards
called Ingrish Hill, about a mile to the westward
of the road. Saebald received his
guests with much cordiality, and after supper
he was quite willing to satisfy the eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
curiosity of the boys about the life and death
of the Viking chief Vidfinn, and about the
strange fate of his children, rumours of which
had reached them.</p>

<p>The hall of the Billingas was lighted with
torches, and after some conversation with
Seomel touching the defences and the supply
of weapons, the good&ndash;natured Saebald turned
to the boys and began his tale. "Vidfinn,"
he said, "was a mighty sea&ndash;rover, and like
Brand, his brother, a stanch follower of the
Eolderman Iffi, father of our king. When
the English first advanced beyond the Ouse
they were led by Brand and Vidfinn, and
Vidfinn eventually formed this frontier station
beyond the road, where he and his followers
settled. He brought two children, a boy and
a girl, with him, named Hjuk and Bil, to
whom he was devoted. He called his burg
after the girl, Bilbrough, and his people
hence were called <i>Billingas</i>. It so happened
that the spring beside his dwelling on the
road was fouled by cattle, and for a time
they had to use the water from a well called
<i>Byrgir</i>, about half a mile up the hill. One
day Hjuk and Bil went up the hill to fetch a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
pail of water. They took a pole named
<i>Simul</i>, on which they slung the bucket <i>Saeg</i>,
and away they went, Bil in front and Hjuk
behind, talking and laughing so that the
people heard them and thought no harm.
But they never returned." The boys had
listened eagerly, and Oswith now asked if
search was made for the lost children. "Yes,
indeed," answered Saebald. "The pole <i>Simul</i>
and the bucket <i>Saeg</i> were found lying near the
well <i>Byrgir</i> in such a position as to make
people think that Hjuk must have fallen
down, and that Bil must have come tumbling
after. But they were both gone. Search was
made in all directions and continued long, but
with no result. Vidfinn was wild with grief.
At length, in gazing at Mani, who, as you
know, is seen on the face of the moon and
directs its course, Vidfinn thought he saw
two children behind him, and he became convinced
that Mani had taken Hjuk and Bil
up from the earth as they were coming from
the well. They help Mani by presiding over
the tides of the ocean, it is thought: Hjuk
looks after the flow, while Bil directs the
ebb, and both together send the long high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
wave up the rivers, which you boys must often
have seen, and which is named after the god
Ægir."</p>

<p>When Saebald paused, the boys ran out
into the road and gazed at the moon. They
then saw, what they had never before observed,
that there really were two children behind
Mani. Astonished and intensely interested,
they returned and entreated Saebald to tell
them the rest of the story of Vidfinn. The
fair&ndash;haired chief of the Billingas said that little
remained to tell, and before beginning he
showed the boys the pole <i>Simul</i> and the
bucket <i>Saeg</i>, which hung on the carved door&ndash;post
of the hall, and had escaped attention
from the Britons. "When Vidfinn had
satisfied himself that his beloved children were
safe in the hands of Mani," resumed Saebald,
"he was consoled, and ten years ago he took
another wife, a daughter of one of the
Billingas, and had a son named Sivel, but the
mother died. Peace had continued so long
that the old Viking was off his guard and
completely taken by surprise when his burg
was attacked at the dead of night by the army
of the Britons. He sent little Sivel away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with a girl, and they escaped to Ulfskelf.
Vidfinn then defended his home desperately,
with his Billingas, and at length he fell amidst
a heap of slain. He was amply avenged by
the King and his brave warriors, and a worthy
tumulus has been raised to the memory of the
founder of Bilbrough. My father was Beorn,
another of his brothers," concluded the Fairfax,
"and as his successor, in the minority of
Sivel, I am proud to be the host of the
valiant Seomel and his knights" (<i>cnihts</i> or
boys). By this time the eyes of the four
boys were heavy, and they no sooner threw
themselves on their heaps of fresh straw in
the hall than they were all fast asleep.</p>

<p>At dawn the two chiefs, Seomel and Saebald,
went up to the Ingrish Hill to inspect the
progress of the stockade and to serve out
weapons to the Billingas, and on the way the
boys were shown the tumulus of Vidfinn, and,
a little farther on, the deep well <i>Byrgir</i>.
The tumulus had been raised on the very
spot where the bucket <i>Saeg</i> and the pole
<i>Simul</i> were found in the grass, so that it is a
monument both to the Viking father and to
the children kidnapped by Mani.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking their leave of the hospitable lord of
Bilbrough, Seomel and the boys rode down the
Roman road and came to the great battle&ndash;field
of Helagh. Seomel showed them the place
where the enemy's slain were buried, which is
called "Hell Hole" to this day. They then
went on to the river Wharfe, and crossed by
the ford of Nehalennia to the old Roman
station of Calcaria, where a strong English
outpost was established. Seomel went a mile
or two down the river, and fixed upon a hill
called Kele&ndash;bor for another military station,
to guard against sudden incursions from
Elmet; while the boys wandered up the
stream to a limestone crag. Here the water
was deliciously cool and clear, so different
from the muddy floods of Wharfe and Ouse,
lower down. They stripped and plunged into
it, and after their bath they went to the
famous shrine of their mother's goddess
Nehalennia at Calcaria. Here, in the midst
of the white limestone country, the guardian
deity of chalk workers and of fruit trees
received highest honour. Here too, among her
favourite white rocks, she lavished her favours
most abundantly among the fruit orchards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
even now the real wine&ndash;sour plum will only
grow on the Brotherton lime, and in the
Sherburn district. Crossing the ford once more,
and riding along the banks of the Wharfe, the
little party was very hospitably welcomed at
Ulfskelf by the grand old warrior Brand and
his wife Verbeia, a sister of the Lady Volisia.
Here Coelred and Porlor made the acquaintance
of the little Sivel, a bright intelligent child,
in whom the strange story told them by
Saebald had made them feel a deep interest.
Taking leave of their cousin Forthere and of
Sivel at Ulfskelf next morning, and of Oswith,
who rode on to Hemingborough, Seomel and
his two sons arrived at their home. Here
they found the Lady Volisia with the children
of Elfric&mdash;Hereric, Bergliot, and Osric&mdash;her
own daughters Braga and Nanna, and the
dog Shuprak. Thus once more was the happy
and united family assembled in the hall of
Stillingfleet, with peace fully restored, and all
fear of danger vanished. How fortunate it is
that it is not given to any of us to know, and
to few of us to foreshadow, what a week or
a month may bring forth.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">KIDNAPPED</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">"I feel the Berserker rage flowing through
me, and arousing the desire to fight and to
kill." It was Hereric who spoke, and he
ended his strange words with a wild shout.
"You, Hereric!" exclaimed Porlor; "why, you
are the gentlest of us all, though no niddring.
How strange that you should be so taken! Yet
I have heard Coifi say that the hour when the
sacred rage inflames us no man knows, but
that it should never be resisted. When it
comes, he told me, we must kill and kill."
He raised another shout, which was echoed
by Hereric and Coelred. "Lead us to the
attack of savage beasts ten times our size,"
said Porlor to Coelred, whose eyes were also
sparkling with excitement. "That will I,"
shouted the elder boy; "I will fight any one
ten times my size," and he threw his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
over his head. The three boys had just been
having their morning bath, and were sitting
and lying on the grass, with their feet in the
water of the brook, which rippled over the
stones.</p>

<p>It was early morning, and they were to
take Bergliot with them into the woods.
When they ran home to get their arms, the
young princess was waiting at the gate. In
a few minutes they joined her, with hosen
cross&ndash;girt, knives at their sides, and spears in
their hands. "We are full of Berserker rage,"
they told her. "You are full of naughtiness"
(the word she used was <i>hinderscype</i>), she
answered, "and will be whipped." Yet their
excitement was contagious, for she ran back
into the hall and returned with a short spear
and Shuprak at her heels. All four then ran
wildly down the hill and over the brook,
shouting and brandishing their spears, with the
dog running and barking in front. Startled
by the noise, the Lady Volisia came to the
gate, and watched them, with anxious eyes,
until they were hidden by the trees. Then
tears trickled down her cheeks. She never saw
the boys again. The wild young creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
made a great circuit in the forest, hurling
their spears at everything, and running at
speed until they came to the willow thicket
where the Stillingfleet brook empties itself
into the river Ouse. Here they paused to
regain their breath.</p>

<p>Presently Bergliot, in looking through the
leafy branches of the willows at the surface of
the water, saw, sitting on a tree trunk on the
edge of the bank, what she thought was a nixy
or water sprite. It was singing, she fancied,
but the sound was scarcely audible. "There
is a nixy," she said in a whisper to the
rest, pointing to where it sat. "Let us kill
it," said Hereric. They all ran forward; the
boys pushed the little creature into the
rushing stream with the butt ends of their
spears, while the girl threw a needle at it,
which is supposed to be fatal to such sprites.
Then they all sang the cruel spell and ran
away:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp4">Nix, Nix&mdash;needle in water,<br />
Virgin casteth steel in water<br />
Thou sink and we flee.</p>

<p class="pn">As they ran they could hear a long wailing
cry, and when they stopped out of breath it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
appeared to all of them to form itself into
these ominous words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp4">Dreadful your doom,<br />
Slaves shall ye be,<br />
Kindred and home<br />
Never to see.</p>

<p class="pn">They looked at each other half&ndash;frightened,
and Bergliot began to cry. She said she
wanted to go home. The boys embraced her
tenderly and kissed her, and Coelred told
Shuprak to see her safe back. As she turned
away she asked them to tell Oswith, if they
saw him, that she hoped he would come to
visit her very soon. She waved a farewell to
them with her hand. Reluctantly, and after
casting many longing glances at his young
masters, the dog went home with the little
girl. "Let us defy the omen," said Coelred:
"let us go further afield to satiate our Berserker
rage," and all three again plunged into
the forest. They ran for hours, hurling their
spears at every creature that came in sight.
At length, on emerging from the forest into
the heathy expanse of Skipwith Common, they
paused for a moment to look round. Close by
there was a huge wild bull of a dun colour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with spreading horns, and three cows. Coelred
uttered a triumphant cry and hurled his spear
at the bull's shoulder. In a moment the
ferocious creature was upon him, threw him
down amongst the heather, and would have
gored and crushed him, if Porlor had not
diverted its attention by driving his spear into
its flank. It turned round foaming with rage
just as Porlor sprang behind a tree and Hereric
faced it on one knee with his spear pointed.
Wild with rage, it dashed in his direction, then
halted with its head up, its eyes glaring, and
foam dropping from its mouth. Coelred had
been stunned for a minute. He now ran up
and attacked the bull in the flank, prodding it
with his spear. Daunted by the vigour of
the attack, the bull now galloped across the
common, followed by the cows. The boys
gave chase, shouting and brandishing their
weapons, coming up with their antagonist
amidst dense underwood, where they succeeded
in killing it with their spears. As the noble
creature fell there was a downpour of rain and
a loud clap of thunder, and amidst the peals
the boys thought they again heard the ominous
curse of the nixy:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp4">Dreadful your doom,<br />
Slaves shall ye be,<br />
Kindred and home<br />
Never to see.</p>

<p class="pn">They dashed wildly on, they knew not whither.
Porlor started a wild&ndash;cat, which sprang up a
tree. He followed with marvellous agility.
The chase turned fiercely at bay, and Coelred
climbed up the tree to help. There was a
desperate fight among the branches, and the
boys got some nasty scratches, but at last one
of them plunged a knife into the cat, it lost
its hold, and fell to the ground. Meanwhile
Hereric had roused a badger from its hole and
kept it at bay with his spear. Its mouth was
open and its rows of sharp teeth glistened. It
would have gone hard with the Atheling if
Coelred had not sprung upon it from behind
and plunged his knife into a vital part. Once
more the three boys resumed their wild career,
with the ominous words of the nixy ringing in
their ears. The sun was low when they
emerged from the forest and came out on the
banks of the muddy Ouse just at the point
where the Wharfe joins it. They were now
exhausted and hungry, so tired indeed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
they could run no more without rest. They
were unhappy too, and frightened at the
sounds which seemed to form themselves into
such dreadful words. The three boys threw
themselves on the grass, and in a minute they
were fast asleep.</p>

<p>They had not seen a long black boat, like
some foul snake, creeping stealthily down the
Wharfe to its confluence. It was flat&ndash;bottomed
and of unusual beam, but low in the water.
The crew consisted of half a dozen villainous&ndash;looking
ruffians, sent by a vessel anchored at
the mouth of the Humber to Calcaria on pretence
of selling some cloths, and the return
cargo was to be stolen. They were sea&ndash;thieves
and cut&ndash;throats. As they descended the
Wharfe they saw Forthere and Sivel fishing
on the bank and suspecting no evil. Four of
them sprang on shore, and in a minute the lads
were bound hand and foot, gagged, and thrown
into the bottom of the boat. A few minutes
afterwards they came in sight of the confluence,
just in time to see Coelred, Porlor, and Hereric
throw themselves on the grass by the opposite
shore. Very stealthily the boat was brought
under the bank. Coelred and Hereric were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
overpowered and bound before they were half
awake. Porlor, however, was aroused by the
footsteps. He had time to draw his knife and
make a desperate resistance, gashing the arm
of one ruffian and stabbing another in the
hand. But he was quickly overpowered. His
two companions were thrown into the bottom
of the boat, where, to their horror and astonishment,
they found Forthere and little Sivel in
like plight. Porlor was put across a thwart
and given an unmerciful beating with a thong
of leather, which, in the dialect of the cut&ndash;throats,
was called a <i>lorum</i>. His young friends
were nearly mad with impotent rage as they
heard the ferocious blows being showered on
the child's body. At last he was thrown,
bruised and bleeding, among the rest; but,
bound as they were, they could do nothing to
console or help him. It all seemed like a
horrible dream; they scarcely knew where they
were, and could do nothing but sob as they
were roused at intervals from a half&ndash;dozing
state.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boat went swiftly down the
Ouse with an ebb&ndash;tide. The villains kept a
sharp look&ndash;out on either bank, and, when half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a mile above Hemingborough, they saw a boy
bathing, and swimming out boldly as the tide
had slackened. Thinking no harm, he caught
hold of one of the boat's oars to rest. In an
instant his wrists were seized, he was bound
hand and foot, and thrown into the bottom of
the boat with the others. It was Oswith.
He was quite naked, and one of the crew
threw a coarse cloth over him. The grief of
the rest of the kidnapped children was redoubled
at the sight of their beloved friend,
the fearless son of Guthlaf. He was as little
able to understand what had really happened
as they were, yet he tried to console them.
He whispered that he would look out for
chances of escape, and reminded them that at
least they had the consolation of being
together.</p>

<p>All through the night the boat kept her
course down the Humber, with the tide against
them during the first watch, but with a fair
wind. Off the mouth of the Trent the sea&ndash;thieves
stopped and made fast, until they were
joined by another smaller boat coming down
that river, which went alongside and passed
another boy on board. In spite of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
misery and discomfort, the kidnapped children
were fast asleep while the boat was waiting in
the mud, and they were aroused by another
little boy being thrown amongst them. He
said that he was Godric the son of Ulchel, a
thegn of the Gainas. He seemed to be as
small as Sivel. After a time the seven
forlorn children went fast asleep as the boat
was rowed down the Humber, and finally came
alongside the vessel whose leader had sent
the thieves on their kidnapping errand.</p>

<p>This vessel was small, but suited for sea&ndash;voyages,
and with much more beam than was
allowed for an ordinary fighting ship. Her
lines were indeed very unlike those of a
dragon ship of the Vikings. For she was
built primarily for trading, and in the second
place for piracy, whenever the opportunity
offered, and she had a capacious hold, now
half full of merchandise. She was lying
off Ravenspur, the site of the Roman station
of Prætorium, under the shelter of Y&ndash;kill, the
Ocellum Promontorium, now Spurn Head.
The seven boys were bundled out of the boat
and into the ship's hold like so many bales
of goods, and the boats were turned adrift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
They had been stolen. The vessel then got
under weigh and hoisted her single sail,
shaping a southerly course, with a strong
breeze which soon freshened into a gale. The
stolen children nestled together and slept long,
for they were quite worn out with anxiety and
grief, to which three of them had added a
day of intense excitement and fatigue. They
awoke quite famished and were given some
food, but throughout the voyage the poor
children were treated with vile inhumanity,
half&ndash;starved, and exposed to the seas which
washed into the vessel during the gale. They
could not have survived many more days of
such treatment. Fortunately the wind was
fair, and the voyage had been a short though
a stormy one, when the piratical thieves
anchored in the port of Amfleet. It is not
known whence they came nor what land was
disgraced by having bred them, nor does it
matter. They were paid and employed by a
trader with more humanity but as little
conscience as themselves.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">MYSTACON</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Mystacon was the principal trader between
Gaul and the northern countries on the one
hand, and Italy and the East on the other,
during the latter part of the sixth century.
He was a Greek, a native of Crete, brought
up by a merchant at Massilia, and his life
had been devoted to mercantile pursuits, in
which his cunning, ability, and absence of
all scruples had enabled him to amass wealth,
which he sought by every means to increase.
In those days Brunehaud, a Gothic princess
from Spain, was Regent of the eastern part of
France, called Austrasia, her husband, King
Sigebert, having been assassinated in 575.
Neustria, which included northern and central
France, was governed by Queen Fredegonda
as Regent to her little son Clotaire II. A
handsome woman of low extraction, she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
waded through murders and other evil deeds
to her lofty position, in which she maintained
herself by her strong will. Capable of any
crime to gain her objects, courageous and
unscrupulous, she must have possessed great
ability and astuteness to have been successful
in maintaining her power so long in that
turbulent age. Her husband, Chilperic I., died
by poison administered by his wife in 584,
and Fredegonda was Regent from that year
until 596. Gontran, the brother of Sigebert
and Chilperic, was King of Burgundy. A
fourth brother, Charibert, King of Paris, who
was father of Bertha, the wife of Ethelbert,
King of Kent, died without male issue in
570. These four brothers were the grandsons
of Clovis.</p>

<p>The Greek trader, when he found that the
fierce nation of the Franks was ruled over by
the Queen&ndash;Regents, Brunehaud and Fredegonda,
hastened to propitiate them by presents,
and to secure their patronage. As
regards Fredegonda he had been successful.
He consulted her wishes, and brought her the
luxuries she required both from the north and
south, always as free offerings. In return he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
was under her protection, his goods were to
pass unmolested through her dominions, and
he was to be assisted by her officers. He had
been granted similar privileges by King
Gontran of Burgundy, whose country included
the shores of the Rhone from Lyons
to the sea.</p>

<p>In his northern trade Mystacon employed
agents to bring him valuable furs and amber,
and even unicorns' horns, from the countries
bordering on the Baltic, tin from Cornwall,
and occasionally he paid sea&ndash;thieves to kidnap
young children from the north, who fetched
high prices in the markets of Rome and Constantinople.
He had a shed at Ambleteuse
where he received his northern merchandise,
preferring that little port to the neighbouring
harbour of Gessoriacum (Boulogne), because
a Frankish officer, from whom his gifts had
secured him favour and protection, was stationed
there with a strong body of disciplined
followers.</p>

<p>Mystacon had been several days at Ambleteuse,
his merchandise was stored in the shed,
and his servants had pack&ndash;horses ready to
convey it southward along the old Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
road, when the vessel from the Humber
anchored off the port and landed its cargo.
The crew was composed of such dangerous
villains that the merchant induced the Queen&ndash;Regent's
officer to post armed men behind
his shed, before he ventured to confer with
them. Besides a pile of beaver skins and
other commodities, seven boys were put on
shore. They stood on the sandy beach close
together, the little ones clinging to the three
bigger lads. All were wet through, and
looked half&ndash;starved and miserable. Porlor
and little Godric were clinging to Coelred.
Sivel had his arms round Forthere, and
Hereric nestled under the sheltering arm of
the son of Guthlaf. Oswith the fearless, who
was nearly naked, with only a bit of sackcloth
round his loins, alone maintained a
defiant look. There was no longer any sign
or token of Berserker rage among the rest.</p>

<p>The wily Greek came forward to look at
them. He saw their great beauty and their
value, but he also saw from their appearance
that they had been cruelly treated. The sea&ndash;thieves
demanded the payment he had promised,
so much for each. "But they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
not in good condition," he remonstrated;
"the price must be reduced." A livid mark
on Porlor's neck caught his quick, searching
eye. He pulled down the boy's shirt, and
saw that his back was covered with weals,
the effect of the cruel flogging he had received.
"Damaged goods," he said. Then,
turning to his servants, he told them to take
the boys into the shed, and to clothe and
feed them. "I will only pay half&ndash;price for
damaged goods," he repeated, turning to the
spokesman of the sea&ndash;thieves. "That little
wild&ndash;cat used his knife on one of us," the
man answered, "and the flogging served him
right." "What is that to me, my friend?"
rejoined Mystacon, in a low but irritating
voice. "You can please yourselves about
damaging your goods, that is your business,
but you cannot expect to get the same price
as if they were not damaged. If a heavy
bale was to fall and hurt one of you, of course
it is open to you to cut and slash it if you
please, and it may serve the bale right. That
I do not dispute. But you must not expect
the same price in the market as if the bale
had not been cut and slashed. I can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
pay you half&ndash;price for the boys." The kidnappers
could not follow the subtle argument
of the Greek, but they began to look dangerous.
The merchant retreated back a few
paces. "Pay us what you promised, thou
cursed cheat, or we will kill thee and the
boys too." He retreated rapidly back and
cried out for help, as the villains drew their
long knives and rushed towards him. In
another minute they were all overpowered and
thrown on the ground by the Frankish guard.
The officer came forward and suggested capital
punishment, offering to hang them in a row.
"It is the just and proper treatment," said
Mystacon, "of those who try to extort full
price for damaged goods from unwary traders.
As soon as your laudable proposal has been
carried into effect, I shall have pleasure in
requesting your lordship to accept the large
sum which the criminals refused." Another
hour had not passed before twenty bodies
were hanging from the branches of the
stunted pines round Ambleteuse, and before
the Frankish officer had an additional reason
for extending his protection to the wily
merchant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Mystacon set out with his train of laden
horses and attendants early next morning,
following the old Roman road by Amiens,
Soissons, and Autun to Lyons. The boys
had been warmly clothed and fed, and had
slept well, nor were they prevented from
having a morning bath in the sea. Two pack&ndash;horses
were allowed them, so that they could
ride by turns, while the rest trotted along on
the road&ndash;side. They found that they could
understand much that was said to them by
the servants, and when Mystacon spoke the
Frank dialect slowly and clearly, they could
comprehend the meaning of nearly every
word. For in those days there was little
difference between the Frankish and other
Teutonic dialects.</p>

<p>The journey across Picardy restored the
health and strength, and revived the spirits,
of the English lads. This limestone tract,
with its keen fresh air, arable surface, and
well&ndash;watered meadows, reminded them of the
country round Calcaria. At Samarobriva,
or Amiens, they rested, and Mystacon was
allowed to store his goods against the wall of
the town, and to encamp there by the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
gate of the Twins, whereon was carved Romulus
and Remus suckled by the wolf. This was the
first opportunity the boys had found of collecting
their thoughts, and holding a serious consultation.
Even now they scarcely understood
what had happened or where they were.
Their first words, as they sat among the bales,
were words of grief at the sorrow and anxiety
of their relations, who would search high and
low through the woods, until at last they gave
them up as dead. "Alca will give them hope
and courage," said Coelred. "She will know
that we are together, and she knows that we
shall return. For we are to die in battle
fighting for a righteous cause, and that cannot
be anywhere but in England. She is
praying now that the gods will watch over us,
and her prayers are ever answered." These
words, spoken with an air of conviction, comforted
the rest. "We must suffer," said Oswith,
"but that does not signify when we
have such good reason for hope. Porlor has
already suffered more than the rest of us."
"At that I rejoice," said Porlor, whose little
head had been teeming with ideas suggested
by Mithras and the bull, ever since he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
gazed on the sculpture at York. "Through
suffering we shall all win the rewards prepared
for the true and brave; and the thong
those niddring thieves called <i>lorum</i> is no word
of bane to me, but of good luck." "Nay,
then," said Hereric, smiling, "we must fasten
it to thy name and call thee Porlorlorum."
"Let it be so," answered the imaginative
child; "it will remind me, and all of us, in
the happy years that will surely come when
this darkness has been turned to light, that
we had to pass through suffering to happiness
and home."</p>

<p>They then began to wonder what their
position really was, and whither Mystacon was
taking them. They had already discovered
that he was a cunning liar, and they believed
nothing he told them, although he had
uniformly treated them with kindness. Forthere
proposed to run away, and both Coelred
and Oswith were inclined to some plan of
making their way across country to the coast,
and seizing a boat. But they would not
attempt it unarmed. Alca had told them
that little Porlor should give them counsel,
and they all turned to him. "My rede is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that we wait to learn more, and to see what
will happen," he said. "I do not fear the
distance this man is taking us from home, if
we have knowledge. A short distance with
ignorance means disaster, perhaps death. A
very great distance is easy to go over with
knowledge of all the obstacles, and of the way
to overcome or avoid them. The wisdom of
Alca and her insight will bring comfort to our
parents. It is for us to remember her words,
to follow them, to wait and watch until the
time comes for us to go home. I know the
time will come, and the gods will watch over
us." "We will wait and watch," they all
said. It was now dark. They laid their
weary heads down side by side, and passed
into a happy sleep. Their dreams were of
home and kindred.</p>

<p>The boys had their morning bath in one
of the numerous bright little trout streams,
bordered by aspen and willow, which flow
down to the sands of St. Valery. Later in the
morning, as they sat talking near the Gate of
the Twins, a monk came out in a long dark&ndash;coloured
cassock, with a rope round his waist.
He was a young man, with a patient look in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
his grey eyes, and a circlet of thick fair hair
round his tonsure. When he saw the lads, he
stopped to improve the occasion. He asked
them if they knew what had happened at that
Gate of the Twins, and he told them the story
of St. Martin. "Out of this gate," he said,
"long, long ago, a brave and virtuous Roman
soldier named Martin rode, on a very frosty
winter's day. He had a cloak wrapped closely
round him, and as he passed along the causeway
he saw a poor man shivering with cold.
Martin drew his sword and, cutting his cloak
in two, he gave half to the beggar. This was
charity, the greatest of all virtues, which covers
a multitude of sins. Martin was afterwards
baptized in the half cloak, and became a
Christian and a Saint." After a pause he
asked, "Are you Christians?" Coelred
answered that they did not so much as know
that there were such people as Christians.
"But," he added, "we know very well that it
is good to give to those who are in need; for
the Princess Alca has taught us." "We know
it," said Hereric, "and we try to remember to
act as she has taught us, but we are not
always able to do right." The hearts of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the boys were warming towards the young
monk.</p>

<p>There was a longer pause, and then the
monk told them that they must be baptized
into the fold of Christ. He raised his voice.
"The Son of God went down into hell, but
now He has risen from the dead." The boys
started to their feet with looks of astonishment
and deep interest. These were almost
the very words spoken by the Princess Alca,
under the ash tree at the foot of Garraby
Hill. "Then Alca is right!" they exclaimed.
"She is always right. The Son of God has
risen." Porlor went on to ask about baptism,
when Mystacon came forward. He had been
listening to the latter part of the conversation,
and did not like it. Concealing his displeasure
by a forced smile, he invented a
lie on the spur of the moment. "By the
order of the Bishop of Noviodunum," he said,
addressing the monk, "these Pagan youths
are being conducted to his city to be duly
instructed and baptized. I thank you for the
interest you have taken in them, but your
help is not needed." There was nothing
more to be said. The good monk gave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
blessing to the boys, and went on his way,
while Mystacon issued hurried orders for the
pack&ndash;horses to be loaded, and in another hour
he and his merchandise were again journeying
southward; but he kept well clear of the city
of Noviodunum (Soissons).</p>

<p>The most anxious part of the journey for
the merchant was approaching. He was
bound to visit the Queen, wherever she might
be, both on the way north and south, and she
took whatever she fancied without paying.
Even this heavy and uncertain tax generally
left a wide margin of profit, but it was a
source of anxiety, and he now feared that
she might take a fancy to the beautiful English
boys. Fortune, however, favoured him.
Fredegonda was, he had ascertained, at the
manor of Braine&ndash;sur&ndash;la&ndash;Vesle, between Soissons
and Rheims, but he had also learned that she
was on the point of departure. He cunningly
timed his arrival on the day that she was to
begin her journey, in the hope that she would
accept a present, and, in the hurry of starting,
forgo her usual practice of rummaging through
the whole contents of his caravan. Late on
the third evening after leaving Amiens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Mystacon encamped outside the gates of
Braine&ndash;sur&ndash;la&ndash;Vesle. This Merovingian palace
was an immense farm, with large unfortified
wooden houses, stables, barns, and cow&ndash;sheds.
In the morning the Franks in attendance on
the royal family began to march out of the
great enclosure. They had a fierce air, with
large and vigorous bodies, inured to cold and
hunger. Their favourite weapon, the battle&ndash;axe
with a short handle, rested on their
shoulders, and they wore their long hair tied
up over their foreheads, forming a kind of
aigrette, then falling behind like a horse's tail.
The long line of the escort of warriors was
followed by several waggons drawn by oxen.
In the first sat Fredegonda, with the little
King Clotaire, then only four years of age.
She was a most formidable&ndash;looking woman,
with a fierce, cruel glance in her large black
eyes, and a haughty bearing. Mystacon
advanced in a cringing attitude, offering a
valuable present, which she accepted, as he
had hoped, without stopping, ordering it to be
put into one of the waggons. As the royal
train passed out of sight, the merchant gave
orders to continue the journey to Lyons, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
way of Bibracte or Augustodunum (Autun).
The boys had seen the warriors, and the great
lady in her waggon. But they had been told
nothing. If Porlor had known that it was the
Queen of the Franks, his rede would probably
have been to rush forward, tell her that Hereric
was an Atheling of Deira, and claim her protection.
But they knew nothing, were kept
behind, and were only allowed to peep between
the bales.</p>

<p>At Lyons the merchant embarked his goods
in a large boat, went down the Rhone to its
mouth, and then sailed in a vessel from
Massilia to the mouth of the Tiber. Before
embarking, the boys again had a long and
anxious talk over their position. Mystacon
had told them lie after lie about their destination,
and they were in great perplexity. He
said that he had saved them from death at the
hands of the sea&ndash;thieves, that he was their
saviour and benefactor, and that the journey
was for their good. They had thought of
telling their captor that Hereric was an
Atheling, but on the whole it seemed to
them that the knowledge might increase the
danger, if it existed, and that their wisest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
course was to keep silence about themselves.
They had enjoyed the journey through France.
The sight of a strange country and of many
things that were new to them had amused and
interested them, and they now looked as bright
and fresh as on the morning when the Berserker
rage so unfortunately seized upon gentle
Hereric, and led to such an unlooked&ndash;for
catastrophe. Their fate was now sealed. After
their embarkation in the boat on the river
Rhone, it would not be many days before they
would enter the imperial city and become the
victims of Mystacon's greed.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">FALLEN ROME</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">In the end of the sixth century the old Rome,
the lingering remnant of the imperial city, had
nearly disappeared. Language, literature, art,
science were being crushed out, not so much
by inroads of barbarians as by the bigotry of
bishops and monks. When the Goths, under
Alaric, entered Rome by the Salarian gate in
410 and revelled in pillage for six days, they
did little or no damage to buildings or works
of art. Half a century afterwards, when
Genseric sacked the city for fourteen days, he
only carried off the gilt&ndash;bronze tiles on the roof
of the Capitoline temple of Jupiter and the spoils
from the temple of Jerusalem; and during the
sack of Ricimer little injury was done to buildings.
Rome suffered more from Totila in 546
than from any former sack, half the walls being
destroyed and many houses being burnt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Theodoric the Goth established his capital
at Ravenna. He took steps to protect the
monuments of Rome, and his reign from 493
to 526 may be considered to have been the
period which saw the last of the true Romans.
Cassiodorus strove to preserve the rapidly failing
taste for the models of classical antiquity.
Boethius, the last of the Romans whom Cato or
Cicero would have acknowledged as their countryman,
threw a flickering ray over the fallen
empire. But both Boethius and his learned
friend Symmachus were murdered by Theodoric
in 526. Long before this the last joyous
festivals of old Rome, the Lupercalia, had been
abolished through the bigotry of Pope Gelasius,
and with them disappeared all living vestiges
of the old life. The buildings were imperishable.
The shell was there amidst dirt and
desolation; the life was gone. Monks pulled
down or defaced the edifices and statues raised
by genius, and the beautiful temple of Apollo
gave place to the cells of Benedict on the
summit of Monte Cassino.</p>

<p>Belisarius and Narses recovered Italy for
the emperors of the East in 536, and Justinian
fixed the capital of his <i>exarch</i> or governor at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Ravenna, not at Rome. But the walls of Rome
were repaired, and partially rebuilt. Only
thirty years afterwards Alboin, with an army
of Lombards, conquered Northern Italy without
encountering any opposition, established an
oppressive aristocracy in the subjugated provinces,
and extended his inroads to the gates
of Rome. This was the condition of affairs
when Mystacon arrived at the mouth of the
Tiber with his merchandise. Maurice Tiberius,
the best of the Eastern emperors, had ascended
the throne at Constantinople in 582. His
exarch Romanus ruled at Ravenna. Young
Autharis had succeeded Alboin as king of the
Lombards in 586, and his armies kept Rome in
perpetual fear. The suburbs were constantly
devastated. The city was vacant and solitary:
the depopulation had been rapid. Famine
was frequent, the edifices were exposed to
ruin, and the chief person in the city was the
Bishop, who exulted over the desolation of
idolatry. His name was Pelagius II., but the
ecclesiastic who possessed the greatest influence
over the miserable remnant of the inhabitants
was the Deacon Gregory. He was a native of
the city, born in 544, and his parents, Gordian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and Sylvia, were of senatorial rank. He was
also wealthy, and he had founded a monastery
on the Caelian Hill, dedicated to St. Andrew.
He was learned in the Scriptures and in the
works of the early fathers of the Church,
and was a voluminous writer both of letters
and of commentaries. While acting as the
Pope's nuncio at Constantinople, he had occupied
himself in a violent controversy with
the Eutychians on the question whether, after
the resurrection, the bodies of the faithful
would be impalpable like air, or palpable
though subtle and sublimed. The former
view was the heresy which Gregory, with the
important aid of the Emperor, effectually
suppressed. He then returned to Rome, and
maintained his influence by relieving distress
through his great wealth and his organising
ability, and also by the power of his pathetic
but rude eloquence. But he was a narrow&ndash;minded
bigot. He hated the monuments of
classic genius, destroyed the magnificent baths
and theatres, and did more harm to the buildings
of Rome than all the barbarians, from
Alaric to Totila, put together. The decided
progress made by the ancients in astronomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and geography was declared to be contrary to
scriptural truth, sculpture was condemned as
an ally of paganism, and both science and art
disappeared. The belief of Gregory that the
end of the world was close at hand also had a
mischievous tendency. As a young man he
was often tormented with pains in the bowels,
and was continually suffering from low fever,
and these ailments probably had their effect
on his temperament. His zeal for the spread
of Christianity perhaps atones for his shortcomings
in other respects, and at all events
Gregory was the leading figure in the Rome of
the end of the sixth century.</p>

<p>The son of the Senator Gordian was not the
only wealthy man in Rome, or it would have
been no place for Mystacon and his wares.
Patricians, with incomes from estates in
Campania and Sicily, still lived in some of the
ruins of departed greatness on the Caelian
Hill. We meet with the names of Decius,
Basilius, Olybrius, Orestes, Maximus, Symmachus,
and Pamphronius. But the sons and
daughters of others were reduced to penury,
and many descendants of consuls and senators
were begging their bread in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Pamphronius was one of those who, by flight
on some occasions and prompt submission on
others, had succeeded in preserving sufficient
of this world's goods to enable him to live in a
partially&ndash;rebuilt villa, and to show signs of
comparative wealth. He had a few clients
round him, and was a customer of Mystacon.</p>

<p>Symmachus Boethius was another survivor
of an ancient and renowned family. His
maternal ancestor had been a bright model of
learning and virtue in the days of Constantine
and his immediate successors. Scholar, statesman,
and orator, he gave new life and vigour
to the literature of Rome, and he was zealous
for the ancient faith. He remonstrated with
the Emperor Gratian on the removal of the
altar of victory from the Senate in 384. His
letters are extant, and that in favour of the
altar of victory is, we are told, infinitely
superior to the verbose, abusive, and dishonest
reply of St. Ambrose. Proconsul in Achaia
and Africa, he had great wealth, estates in
Campania, Sicily, and Mauritania, and a mansion
on the Caelian Hill. His descendants for
four generations were all distinguished. The
fifth in descent, named Quintus Aurelius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Memmius Symmachus, had an only daughter
Rusticiana. She was happily married to
Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, whose
father was consul in 487. Boethius was
famous for his learning and for his charities.
He was accused of a wish to free Rome from
the Goths, was condemned unheard, and put
to death, with his son, by order of Theodoric.
His <i>Consolatio Philosophiæ</i>, written in prison,
shows that he was not a Christian. Rusticiana
was reduced to poverty until her property was
restored by Theodoric's daughter Amalasontha.
At the sack of Rome in 541 she was again
reduced to beggary, and was only saved from
death by the intervention of Totila.</p>

<p>Anicius Severinus Boethius, the son of the
great Boethius and of Rusticiana, was consul
in 522, and died, soon after his mother, in 570.
He had succeeded in recovering his Sicilian
estates, and in raising the fortunes of his
family sufficiently to be able to reside in the
fine old mansion of the Symmachus family on
the Caelian. His son Symmachus Boethius
continued to prosper, and, at the time of which
we speak, he was one of the few wealthy
patricians of Rome. His wife was a virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
lady named Otacilia. His villa made some
pretensions to its ancient splendour, and its
owner, now a man between fifty and sixty,
outwardly conformed to the Christian religion,
as all who valued their peace and safety were
bound to do in those days. The religion of
Ambrose and of Gregory became a persecuting
religion as soon as its hierarchy had the power
to persecute. In this and in other essentials
it differed widely from the religion of Christ.
By ready conformity the patricians Pamphronius
and Symmachus Boethius maintained
friendly relations with the Deacon Gregory and
his monks of St. Andrew, who were their
neighbours on the Caelian Hill. They were
consulted on the affairs of the city, especially
on the absorbing questions relating to food&ndash;supply,
but all real power was in the hands
of the Bishop and clergy, whose preaching
swayed the mob. Gregory was, indeed, a remarkable
personality. His character presented
a singular mixture of sense and superstition,
pride and humility, simplicity and cunning;
and through all there was that touch of
sympathy which secured the support of the
multitude, and that burning and impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
zeal which seemed to carry all before it, and
which was mainly directed to the propagation
of his faith. His worst trait was his unprincipled
time&ndash;serving. When the good Emperor
Maurice was murdered, whom he knew well,
and from whom he had received much kindness,
he wrote a flattering letter to his murderer
Phocas, one of the most infamous wretches
that ever disgraced the purple, which is
worded in a way that is simply revolting. It
needs much zeal to atone for such baseness.</p>

<p>These were the leaders of Rome, but not of
living Rome. They were like small crabs in
a great dead shell. It is difficult to realise
the effect on the mind of any one then
coming to Rome for the first time, and gazing
upon the superb baths and theatres, the
splendid temples and halls in long vistas, all
desolate and abandoned, with here and there
a priceless work of art thrown down and
broken. Everywhere silence and desolation,
except where some monk might be seen
preaching to a squalid group, or where half&ndash;starved
crowds assembled at church doors for
doles of food. The population had dwindled
from millions to thousands, and clergy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
taken the place of soldiery and well&ndash;to&ndash;do
citizens of the empire, but in much smaller
numbers. Still there were a few wealthy
people, sufficient to induce traders to expose
valuable goods for sale.</p><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mystacon, when he arrived in his vessel,
found the port of Ostia quite empty, and
there was ample space at his disposal in the
long row of dilapidated emporia facing the
Tiber, at the foot of Mount Aventine. Here
his goods were warehoused until the day of
the market, which was then held in the
beautiful Forum of Trajan. He now had to
disclose his real intention to the English boys.
He had safely housed them in a large room,
with plenty of his own hirelings always more
or less on guard outside. He opened his communication
by dwelling upon his kindness
and liberality, on having saved their lives
when the sea&ndash;thieves would have killed them,
and on the gratitude they owed him. At last
the truth came out. He would be obliged to
sell them in the market, owing to the great
expense they had been to him, and if a
sufficient sum could not be obtained, he
would have to take them to Ravenna or to
Constantinople. He was unprepared for the
outburst of rage and fury with which his base
scheme was received by the little boys. They
told him that Hereric was an atheling, and
that all were the sons of thegns, better born
than any one in Rome. Their eyes flamed
with Berserker madness as they cried out that
they would kill him as they would kill a wild&ndash;cat
or a badger, and Forthere actually flew at
his throat. The coward was taken by surprise.
He cried out for help, and could not
collect his ideas and decide upon the course
to take until the lads were all tied hand and
foot. He was in great perplexity. A violent
scene at the market was out of the question.
His wish was to flog them within an inch
of their lives; but, as he had told his deceased
accomplices, damaged goods only fetch half&ndash;price.
He must display them with whole
skins. At last he determined to starve them
into submission. He told them that they
would have no food until they consented to
go quietly to the Forum, and left them with
the door well barred. For more than thirty&ndash;six
hours they resolutely held out, but the bigger
boys could not bear to hear little Godric and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Sivel crying for food. They turned to Porlor
for his counsel. None of them had been more
furious, none of them now felt a stronger
desire to kill the treacherous villain who had
employed the kidnappers, as they now fully
believed. He said that the shame was almost
more than they could bear, but that it would at
least be a great gain to be free from Mystacon.
No master could be worse, and when they
were older and stronger they could defy any
master to detain them. "But the shame! the
shame!" moaned Coelred and Oswith, as they
lay with their heads in their hands prone to
the ground. It had to be done. The next time
Mystacon came, Porlor told him to bring food,
and that they would go without resistance.
The boys had few words and could not scold.
But the villain was told that they knew him
as he was, far viler and baser than the sea&ndash;thieves,
a niddring and a liar, and that some
day they would kill him. He sent them
plenty of food, and his sickly smile betokened
malice not unmixed with fear. His mind was,
however, relieved: he would get his price.</p>

<p>"To be sold as slaves!" In all their
thoughts of possible danger and suffering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
they had never anticipated anything so bad
as this. They called to mind the words that
the sounds in the forest seemed to form
themselves into, and shuddered. But after
hours of despondency the brave little fellows
took heart. Coelred was the leader who now
urged his companions to remember the words
of the Princess. They talked long and
anxiously, but before they laid down their
heads to sleep, they had, with one accord,
all raised their right hands and cried&mdash;"Come
what may, we will quit ourselves like men&mdash;above
all, like Englishmen!"</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">IN BONDAGE AT ROME</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The Forum of Trajan was as yet uninjured.
The noble rows of buildings with colonnades,
including the once well&ndash;stored library, still
surrounded the large paved court, and in
the centre stood the beautiful column with
its elaborate representation in bronze of the
events of the Dacian war. Here important
markets were held, and on one autumn
morning of the year 588 several merchants,
who had lately arrived, exposed many things
for sale. Abundance of people resorted thither
to buy. Mystacon had his wares arranged
under a colonnade. He invited attention in a
cringing attitude, seeking for purchasers. The
English boys stood in a group quite naked,
their eyes full of tears of shame and rage.
Among the first people who stopped in front
of them was a thin and emaciated ecclesiastic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
accompanied by another, who was younger
and of stouter build. The older man had
an aquiline nose and hollow cheeks, bright
piercing eyes, which had assumed a gentle
expression, and a somewhat commanding air.
It was Gregory himself, then aged forty&ndash;four,
and his secretary Peter. Mystacon bowed
low before them. Gregory looked at the
boys with admiration, and turning to the
merchant, he remarked that their bodies were
white, their countenances beautiful, and their
hair very fine. Mystacon bowed still lower.
"From what country or nation were they
brought?" he asked. The reply was that
they came from the island of Britain, whose
inhabitants are of that personal appearance.
"Are these islanders Christians, or are they
still involved in the errors of Paganism?" was
the next inquiry. He was told that they
were Pagans. Fetching a deep sigh, he
exclaimed&mdash;"Alas! what pity that the author
of darkness is possessed of men of such fair
countenances, and that, being remarkable for
such graceful aspects, their minds should be
void of inward grace. What," he demanded,
"is the name of that nation?" The kidnapper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
replied that they were called Angles.
"Right," said Gregory, "for they have angelic
faces, and it becomes such to be co&ndash;heirs with
the angels in heaven. What is the name," he
proceeded, "of the province from which they
are brought?" The reply was that the name
of the province was Deira. "Truly are they
<i>De irâ</i>," said he, "withdrawn from wrath and
called to the mercy of Christ. How is the
king of that province called?" Mystacon said
that his name was Ella; and Gregory, alluding
to it as he walked on, observed to Peter that
Hallelujah, the praise of God the Creator, must
be sung in those parts. Gregory was on
his way to have an interview with the Pope,
and on coming into his presence, he proposed
that ministers should be sent to the English,
by whom they might be converted to Christ;
and, in his impulsive way, he declared that he
was ready to undertake that work himself, by
the assistance of God. Pelagius replied that
he was willing to grant his request, but that
the people would never consent to his departure.
Gregory then entrusted to Peter
the business of purchasing some of these
"Angles," and sent him back to the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys did not understand a word of
the remarks made by Gregory and by other
passers&ndash;by who stopped to question Mystacon.
Presently two patricians, advanced in years,
followed by clients and attendants, walked
into the Forum and stopped at the colonnade
where the lads were still exposed. After
gazing upon them, Symmachus Boethius observed
to his companion Pamphronius that
he had never seen such perfect symmetry
and beauty except in ancient sculpture.
"The works of Praxiteles are looked upon
with disapproval by our good friends the
priests, so I would fain ornament my villa
with living forms that would be worthy of
the chisel of the most gifted sculptor of
antiquity." Pamphronius expressed his concurrence,
and his desire to possess at least
two of the young slaves. Calling Mystacon
aside, they made various inquiries, and concluded
bargains by which Symmachus Boethius
became the owner of Coelred and Porlor, while
Oswith and Sivel fell to Pamphronius. Their
clients were instructed to complete the arrangement
and pay the purchase&ndash;money, and the
great men passed on. No sooner were they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
out of sight, than Peter arrived breathless
to carry out the instructions of his
master. Mystacon was delighted, for his
troubles and anxieties were fully repaid.
Peter agreed to his terms, and the Atheling
Hereric, Forthere, and Godric became the property
of the Deacon Gregory.</p>

<p>The boys were thus relieved from their
shameful and degrading position, which they
had looked forward to with such horror and
dismay. Their clothes were restored to them,
and they were told by signs to accompany
the servants of the patricians and Peter, the
road of all being the same, namely, that leading
to the Caelian Hill. Casting looks of vindictive
hatred at Mystacon, they gladly accompanied
their new acquaintances.</p>

<p>Of all the seven hills of Rome, the Caelian
was the most favoured by the wealthier classes
during the latter days of the empire, and their
villas were scattered over it, half&ndash;hidden by
groves of cypress trees. But the troublous
times had wrought destruction, and most of
them were now in ruins. Facing the Palatine,
where the imperial palace stood desolate
and abandoned, was the monastery of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Andrew, the villas of Symmachus and Pamphronius,
and the deserted temple of Divus
Claudius, while just below ran the Appian
Way. In rear stood the Sacellum Dianæ,
the arch of Dolabella, and the chapel containing
little votive ships of marble, reminding
the boys of the votive boats in the
tumulus of Vidfinn at Bilbrough. The aqueduct
of Nero entered Rome at the back of
the Caelian Hill, and was one of the few
which still brought water to the city; and
to the south were the Lateran Palace and
the famous Asinarian Gate, by which Totila
and his army entered in 546, through the
treachery of some Isaurian sentries.</p>

<p>The villa of Symmachus was the best and
most perfect that remained in the Rome of
Gregory. The atrium and adjacent halls were
of noble proportions; there was a large garden
in the rear, full of myrtles and other shrubs;
and beyond were the stables, near which Coelred
and Porlor were provided with a <i>cubiculum</i> to
themselves. Symmachus only required the
lads to attend him on certain occasions, and
to perform outdoor work, to which they felt
no objection. He was a man of a kindly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
somewhat timid disposition, fond of a certain
amount of display, and with cultivated tastes.
His amiable wife Otacilia was very kind to
the lads. They had liberty to wander over
the city, and Porlor was full of eager
curiosity.</p>

<p>Pamphronius was less wealthy; his villa
was of smaller proportions and in a more
ruinous condition, and he himself was a man
of a more exacting disposition, and with less
natural kindliness than his neighbour. Yet
Oswith and little Sivel were well treated, and
they were very fortunate in the companionship
of a son of one of the freedmen of Pamphronius
named Bassus, who was some years older than
Oswith. This youth was of mixed Roman and
Gothic descent, tall for his age and handsome,
and well educated, being able to speak the
Greek language, as well as the debased Latin
then talked at Rome, and having picked up
much of the ancient lore, in addition to what
he had been taught of Christianity. Bassus
from the first conceived an ardent boyish
attachment for Oswith and a warm friendship
for all the English lads, and he continued to
be a valued and faithful companion to the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of their lives. He was destined to survive
them all but one.</p>

<p>With their life in the monastery of St.
Andrew the three others, or at least two of
them, were not so well pleased. The prior,
named Augustine, was a disciplinarian, inclined
to be harsh and imperious to those
under him, and his humility was of that kind
which is nearly related to pride. Times had
to be observed, rules must be respected; yet
the lads enjoyed a certain share of liberty.
The gentle and self&ndash;respecting Hereric fell
more easily into the regular ways of the
monks. He considered it to be more dignified
to obey, and he was deeply interested in the
new ideas and conceptions conveyed in the
little he could understand of the teaching of
Peter, who was appointed to instruct them
before baptism. But Forthere hated the confinement
and the whole life, longing for the
sports and adventures of the forests to which
he had been accustomed. Little Godric followed
the lead of Forthere, who was rebellious
from the first. The monks found it necessary
to correct him before he had been an inmate
more than a few days, and they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
proceeded to more severe measures if he had
persisted in his disobedience. The loyal devotion
of Forthere to his companion as an
atheling, and his sincere affection for Hereric
himself, were the motives which probably
saved him. For Hereric's sake he would submit
when he would have been cut to pieces
before he would have obeyed a monk; and, in
fact, the authorities ruled him through the
influence of the Atheling. The fierce young
Englishman was a true son of Brand of
Ulfskelf, the mighty warrior and most loyal
of all the followers of King Ella. Like his
father, young Forthere could brook no tyranny,
but, like his father, he would die for any atheling
of the house of Deira.</p>

<p>A monk named Laurentius was appointed
to instruct the four boys outside the monastery.
They understood very little that he told them,
and that through the help of Bassus, for as
yet they could only exchange thoughts by
means of a few signs and words established
between themselves and their new friend.
Nevertheless, Gregory caused all the seven
English lads to be baptized without further
delay, deciding that the instruction of Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and Laurentius had been sufficient. In a very
few months Bassus taught them the language
then in use at Rome, a dialect of Latin in
process of conversion into Italian, and they
were able to understand all that was said
to them, as well as to hold conversations.
He then began to teach them Greek, the
language of the imperial court and of commerce,
and the boys in the villas of the two
patricians worked hard to acquire it, Bassus
having impressed upon them that it alone
would enable them to comprehend fully the
many strange things they would see and hear,
and would give them the knowledge which was
power.</p>

<p>Coelred, Oswith, and Porlor, with Bassus
as their guide, had wandered through the
almost deserted streets of Rome, and gazed
with wonder and admiration on the magnificent
edifices, which were then neglected and
dilapidated, but not actually in ruins. They
had especially examined the fine temple to
the Sun erected by the Emperor Aurelian on
the Quirinal, and while they rested under its
ornate portico, Bassus had explained the true
import of Mithras stabbing the bull. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
opened a whole world of imaginative speculation
in the mind of Porlor, who had never
forgotten his wonder at the sight of the bas&ndash;relief
in the cave at York. On another day
they crossed the Tiber and visited Constantine's
basilica dedicated to St. Peter, which
presented a sorry appearance when compared
with the monuments of antiquity. The sides
were of plain unplastered brick, with arched
openings for windows, and in front there were
figures and emblems painted in fresco, in a
very debased style of art. Even a child must
have been impressed with the superiority of
the ancient edifices. The English boys called
to mind the impression they had received
from beholding the ruins of Roman temples
at York; and how it had been borne in upon
their minds that a mighty empire had passed
away, and that it was for their countrymen
to build something greater on its ruins. These
ideas now recurred to them with immeasurably
greater force as they sat together under the
portico of the desecrated temple of Jupiter
on the Capitol, and commanded a view of the
graceful temples round the Forum, of the palace
rising above them on the Palatine, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
long vista of edifices terminating with the
Colosseum. The warm sun and deep blue sky
gave a brilliance to the scene, which contrasted
with the signs of decay that could be detected
by the eye, in places where broken statues and
pavements and heaps of fallen tiles denoted
the desolation of the present time. Bassus
told them how the Forum used to be crowded
with citizens, he showed them the place whence
great senators and orators used to make
speeches to the people, and he described the
processions of the lupercalia and of the milites.
All had passed away. Their young thoughts
were not depressed. They reflected on what
was to follow, on another great people arising
to replace the dead Roman Empire. But they
did not think that it was to be found here
among the monks and the debased rabble of
Gregory's Rome. Their aspirations turned to
the North, to the homes of Deira, and to the
stalwart English, irresistible in war and open
to new ideas and fresh knowledge. It was
becoming something more than a dream
amongst them, that it was ordained that they
should bring back to their kindred these new
ideas and this fresh knowledge. They would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
diligently learn all that could be useful to
their people in the lands of the ancient
civilisation, until they were old enough to
wear swords and take their places as men in
the battle array; and then they would return,
if need be fighting their way home. This
was the result of many discussions and conversations,
held among the cypress groves of
the Caelian Hill, after exploring excursions
through the desolate city.</p>

<p>The boys from the two villas usually took
their morning bath in a tank near the <i>navicula</i>,
which was shaded by trees and supplied
with water from Nero's aqueduct. Here, too,
the Atheling, with their cousin Forthere and
little Godric, often joined them, and they
talked over their prospects, and discussed all
the wondrous things they had seen and heard.
The Christian religion had been more clearly
explained to them when they acquired the
use of the language then talked at Rome.
They understood that the Son of God had
died for all mankind, and that He had risen
from the dead. They knew that they must
pray to Him for guidance and to keep them
from sin, and they all did so. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
thought that the teaching of Laurentius and
Peter was the same as the far more impressive
and beautiful teaching of the Princess Alca.
In their conception Christ was another name
for Balder. But they kept these opinions to
themselves, and gave the name of Christ to
the Son of God they worshipped.</p>

<p>Often taking counsel together, they formed
a small <i>Gemót</i>, as they called it, of seven
little boys, with the world of Rome against
them, all except Bassus, whom they had made
one of themselves. Hereric invented a watchword
to warn them of the approach of strangers
who might disturb their meetings in the cool
cypress groves. It consisted of the two words
<i>Bylr</i>, a tempest, and <i>Grima</i>, a thing helmeted
or veiled. The meaning was that the unknown
or veiled one might betoken a storm for them.
For they conversed respecting all the affairs
of Rome, speculated on the hidden meanings
of all they heard, and talked over the time
for rising against their oppressors and fighting
their way home. There were two or three
people whom Forthere intended to kill first,
including Mystacon.</p>

<p>So time passed on, and after two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Gregory succeeded to the Pontificate. He
had not forgotten his project of sending a
mission to the Angles, and was mindful of
the advantage of having youthful interpreters
ready on the Caelian. But for a long time
the miserable condition of Rome absorbed his
attention. The state of affairs had become
perilous. The corn ships failed to arrive time
after time, and these failures caused misery
among the people. It was a common occurrence
to see crowds clamouring for food at
the doors of St. Peter's and at the Lateran.
A total cessation of the Egyptian corn trade
was threatened, while the supply from Sicily
was becoming more and more precarious.
Even greater danger threatened Rome from
the north. The Lombards made constant
incursions, riding over the Campagna, devastating
the suburbs, and insulting the sentries
guarding the gates of the city.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory appealed to the exarch at
Ravenna for help, but that official was unable
to do more than maintain his own position,
which was also threatened. There were frequent
consultations between the Pope and his
clerical advisers and the leading patricians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
The outlook was most serious. At last it was
determined that an embassy should be sent
to Constantinople to represent to the Emperor
Maurice the absolute necessity for making
efficient arrangements to supply Rome with
corn, and to entreat him to send an army to
drive back the Lombards and put a stop to
their incessant inroads, which were desolating
Southern Italy. Symmachus Boethius and
Pamphronius were requested to be the ambassadors,
and after some pressure from the
Pope they rather unwillingly consented, for
it would be an expensive and probably a
thankless service. They resolved to take
several attendants, including the four English
boys and young Bassus.</p>

<p>This startling and important news came
as a great surprise to the little society. As
yet they had never been separated. Oswith
consulted Bassus, and told him that they
must bind each other always to be steadfast
friends, in the most solemn manner possible.
Their compact must include a firm resolution
that when they returned home none should
be left behind. He asked Bassus how this
could be done with the most binding solemnity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
"It must be an oath to God," advised his
friend, "which in the Hebrew tongue is
Lilla. The most solemn thing that you can
do," added Bassus, "is to change your name
from Oswith to Lilla, as a memorial and a
testimony. This will make the deepest impression
on the rest."</p>

<p>For the last time before the separation all
the boys assembled under the shady trees by
the tank of the <i>navicula</i>. Much sorrow
was expressed at parting, but all anticipated
wonderful things, and probably much good,
from the visit to Constantinople. They all
took the oath of constant friendship, and that
no one should be left behind when they
fought their way home. "It is the oath of
God," said Oswith, "and to impress it on our
hearts, from henceforth my name shall be
Lilla." "We declare," they all answered,
"that we will call you Lilla for evermore as
a testimony of our compact." They embraced
each other. Little Sivel parted from his
adopted brother Forthere with bitter tears.
All took tender farewells of Hereric the
Atheling, whom they fondly loved, of Forthere,
and of Godric. It was a sad parting, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
they looked forward to meeting again at the
same place.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the two patricians
embarked at Brundusium for Constantinople,
accompanied by Lilla, Coelred, Porlor, Sivel,
Bassus, and other attendants.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">THE GLORIES OF THE EAST</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">At Rome everything reminded a visitor of
past greatness. Constantinople, on the other
hand, was the new Rome, the grandest and
most magnificent city in the world. For
nearly three centuries the revenues of the
empire had been lavished upon her edifices,
all the treasures of art had been brought from
far and near to adorn her palaces and theatres,
and her churches were decorated with marble
and gold and every precious material the earth
could yield. Her unrivalled position on the
shores of the Propontis, her harbour of
Chrysoceras (or the "Golden Horn"), and
the beautiful wooded shores of the Bosphorus
surrounded her with every charm and every
luxury, and combined to make the city of Constantinople
the most splendid capital ever raised
by genius commanding unlimited resources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>After their arrival the Roman patricians
had to wait some days for an audience with
the Emperor. They had visited the capital
before, but no one could ever tire of gazing
on that unequalled architectural display.
Boethius and Pamphronius walked through
the city followed by their attendants; and
the English boys, confused at the magnificence
around them, were half dazed with wonder
and admiration. They stood in the elliptically&ndash;shaped
forum of Constantine, with triumphal
arches at the two opposite entrances, and
colonnades all round, filled with the statues
of the gods, with shrines dedicated to Cybele
and to Fortune, and a lofty pillar in the
centre. This specially attracted their attention.
It was 120 feet high, of marble and
porphyry, surmounted by a statue of the
Emperor Theodosius. Next they were taken
to another forum, which was square and also
surrounded by porticoes, with an elevated
arcade adorned with statues, and the golden
miliarium in the centre. The Hippodrome
also filled them with astonishment, 300 paces
long, and the space between the two goals
filled with statues and obelisks. They saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the wreathed column of bronze which bore the
golden tripod of Delphi, and the Emperor's
throne, with the winding staircase called
<i>Cochlea</i> descending to the palace. They
encountered palaces, churches, and baths at
every turn; and were taken to see the underground
cistern, or rather lake, with an arched
roof supported on 336 marble pillars. Even
more surprising to them were the baths of
Zeuxippus, the most beautiful in the world,
adorned with the greatest triumphs of Grecian
art, the Muses of Helicon, the Athene of
Lyndus, and the Amphitrite of Rhodes. It
all seemed like a gorgeous dream which might
suddenly melt away. When their eyes met,
their looks told each other of their amazement,
but they were too much astonished to
express themselves in words. It was, however,
the life and movement which made these
scenes so striking and so vivid. Horsemen,
foot passengers hurrying to and fro, troops
marching, bright colours everywhere in
motion, gave animation and interest to the
marvellous buildings, so different from poor
deserted Rome. They strolled on to the Golden
Gate, and back to the Augusteum, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
colossal equestrian statue of Justinian in an
attitude of defiance absorbed their attention for
a few moments, and then their eyes glanced
beyond it to the crowning glory of his
architectural work.</p>

<p>They had scarcely room for more wonder
when they came before the great church dedicated
to Divine Wisdom. Yet the interior,
as they entered, almost took their breath away.
St. Sophia had been restored and rededicated
by Justinian about a quarter of a century
before, in 563. The beautiful columns of
green marble from Ephesus, of porphyry from
Aurelian's Sun Temple at Rome, the ornaments
and figures in carved stone, the decorations
in gold and marbles of the most precious kinds,
the walls encrusted with mosaics, the richly&ndash;carved
capitals, and the exquisite proportions
of the aerial dome, all combined to form the
most perfect and beautiful church that had
ever been erected. The gorgeous services, with
long processions of richly&ndash;dressed priests and
their attendants, solemn music and singing,
and the delicious scent of incense, completed
their wonder and awe. The boys remained in
a sort of dream of astonishment for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
days, until the time arrived for the audience.
The patricians were richly dressed, and their
attendants, in suitably handsome attire, were
to accompany them to the palace.</p>

<p>The Emperor Maurice Tiberius had ascended
the throne in the year 582. Descended from
an ancient Roman family settled in Asia Minor,
he was born at Arabissus in Cappadocia, spent
his youth at the court of Justin II., and afterwards
served with distinction in the Persian
war. His accession was due to the best of
all reasons, his loyalty to his predecessor
Tiberius Augustus, whose daughter he married.
Maurice was forty&ndash;three years of age when he
became emperor, and he was an excellent
ruler, promoting the happiness of his people
with sense and courage. He was a rigid
economist, and his demeanour was cold and
reserved. Soon after his accession another
war with Persia broke out, and when the
embassy came from Rome, the general
Heraclius had just returned from Mesopotamia
after gaining a great victory.</p>

<p>Rigid etiquette and a display of pomp and
magnificence at court ceremonials had been
introduced by Diocletian and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
increased by successive emperors. The palace
was a vast building on the shores of the
Propontis between the Hippodrome and the
church of St. Sophia. When the embassy from
Rome arrived at the appointed time it was
met by the Master of the Offices and his
attendants, and the patricians, being of
consular rank, were accosted with the title of
"illustrious." After an interval they were
ushered into the presence. The Emperor
was in the great audience&ndash;hall called <i>Chalce</i>
(from its brazen doors), which consisted of a
dome supported by massy pillars, walls encrusted
with mosaics representing African and
Italian triumphs, and a pavement of many&ndash;coloured
marbles. The imperial throne was
surrounded by the great officers of state, and
by favoured courtiers, all gorgeously dressed.
There stood the Praepositus or Prefect of
the Bedchamber with attendant Counts, the
Quaestor or Chancellor, the Count of the
Sacred Largesses, the Count of the Privy Purse,
the Commanders of the Guards, the victorious
generals Heraclius, Comentiolus, Narses, and
Priscus, and several bishops. There also were
Athanagild, a tall and handsome young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Gothic Prince, the philosopher Metrodorus, the
famous physician Alexander, the lawyer&ndash;poet
Agathias, and many others.</p>

<p>There were numerous presentations, and
when the turn of Boethius and Pamphronius
came, those illustrious patricians made low
obeisance, and stated the case set forth in
their instructions from the Holy Father
Gregory, touching the sore need of prompt
assistance in which the city of the seven hills
then stood. They were told that they would
receive their answer on a future day. Many
eyes were turned on the handsome youths,
whose good looks were enhanced by their rich
and well&ndash;fitting clothes, and the patricians
soon had reason to regret that they had taken
those means of increasing their own importance
by the brilliance of their suite. In leaving
the palace the boys made way for Priscus the
general, and they were struck by the revolting
appearance of the soldier who held his horse.
He was a short man with red hair and shaggy
eyebrows, and his face was disfigured by a
great scar. He looked a savage and malicious
barbarian; yet this man was Phocas, the
successor of Maurice as Emperor of the East!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
whose monument, a tall column with an
inscription, is still standing in the Forum at
Rome.</p>

<p>During the following days the patricians
received many visits. Narses, then one of
the most trusted of the Emperor's generals,
paid his respects, and took special notice of
Lilla and Bassus. Stephanos, the Count of
the Sacred Largesses, also came, and was very
much attracted by the intelligent appearance
of little Sivel. The Gothic Prince Athanagild
was another visitor. He was a young scion
of the royal house of Spain, who had taken
refuge at the court of Maurice from the
persecution of King Recared. Athanagild
was also a grandson, through his mother, of
Queen Brunehaud of Austrasia. During his
exile he had formed a friendship with the
physician Alexander, through whom he had
heard of the Indian voyages of Cosmas. Fond
of adventure, he was now keen to follow in the
course of the old navigator, and was looking
out for trusty followers. His eyes fell upon
Coelred and Porlor, and he at once conceived
a strong desire to secure their services.</p>

<p>It was too late for the patricians to regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
their imprudence in displaying their precious
human property so openly; and just at this
time Symmachus Boethius fell dangerously ill.
The physician Alexander attended him, but
his charms and amulets were of no avail. A
few days after the death of his colleague,
Pamphronius was summoned to receive his
answer, and he was served with an order,
through the Count of the Domestics, to bring
the five youths with him who had been in the
suite of the embassy at the former reception.
The Emperor gave him audience at the lovely
summer residence of Heroeum, a villa with
gardens extending down to the sea, on the
Asiatic side of the Propontis, near Chalcedon.
Maurice was not encouraging. He said that
he had ordered some ships laden with grain to
be sent to the Tiber; but that he could give
no military aid, owing to the disturbed state
of affairs in Persia. The Emperor, indeed,
told Pamphronius that he was himself on his
way to Antioch with all the forces he could
collect. His advice was that King Childebert
of Austrasia should be bribed to invade
Northern Italy and give employment to the
Lombards. He also promised to instruct the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Exarch of Ravenna to co&ndash;operate with Childebert.</p>

<p>Pamphronius then had to take his leave;
but before he embarked to return to the city
he was informed by the Praepositus that the
five youths were required for the public
service, and would be detained at Heroeum.
He protested strongly, but was merely told
that he could, if he chose, recover them by
process of law when their services were no
longer under requisition by the State. Pamphronius
returned to Rome with little but good
advice as the result of his embassy, having lost
his colleague by death, and his two slaves, for
whom he had paid high prices to Mystacon, by
an arbitrary act which, from his point of view,
amounted to plunder. He felt very indignant.</p>

<p>Great preparations were, in fact, being
made for a Mesopotamian campaign, rendered
probable by the disturbances in Persia. The
army was already on the march to Antioch
by way of the Cilician Gates. Ships were
assembled at Chalcedon and other ports, and
the Emperor Maurice himself, with some of
his principal officers and generals, was about
to embark for the coast of Syria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys had been lodged, with the attendants
of the Emperor's household, in buildings
near the gardens of Heroeum. They were
able, thanks to their friend Bassus, to converse
in Greek, and to understand what had
taken place. They welcomed the chances that
were now opening to them of taking part in
some warlike adventure, and of emulating the
deeds of their Viking ancestors, before again
returning to Rome. Next day Lilla and
Bassus were appointed to posts in the army,
as pages in attendance on Narses. Little
Sivel was taken into the household of the
Treasurer Stephanos, who intended to employ
the quick&ndash;witted and intelligent boy in one of
the State departments under his charge, probably
in the mint at Antioch.</p>

<p>Athanagild was of an enterprising and
roving disposition, and on the death of his
father Hermenegild at Toledo in 586, his
uncle Recared succeeded, and he fled to the
court of his grandmother at Metz. But a
violent quarrel with his uncle Childebert led
to his banishment, and he found safety with
the Emperor Maurice. Having been nursed
through an illness by the physician Alexander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a close friendship was formed between them,
and he thus heard of the voyages to India by
the aged monk Cosmas, who was intimate
with the physician. He had also been told
of the great military exploits of Gollas, King
of the White Huns, in those parts, and he
resolved to find his way to that distant and
unknown land, and to offer his sword to the
conqueror. He had vague dreams of sovereignty
and dominion for himself. His great
object now was to find a pilot and a trusty
crew to take him to India by the route of
Cosmas. Alexander gave him friendly help
and advice, and obtained for him a pilot in
the shape of Monas, an old companion of
Cosmas, who would find a vessel if supplied
with funds. The Gothic Prince was now
looking for two or three followers who
would work under Monas, and whom he could
thoroughly trust. He had taken a fancy for
Coelred and Porlor at first sight. He admired
their stalwart young limbs, and their faces
with an expression open as the day, where no
lie could find a place. He felt sure that, if once
gained over, they would be loyal and true.</p>

<p>Athanagild was a tall, handsome young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
man, with a winning manner, and when he
told the boys that he was a Geata, whose
deeds they had heard of in the song of Beowulf,
he won their hearts. They remembered
how often Coifi had sung of the Geatas and
their exploits; and as they thought of the old
hall at home, where the gleeman was wont to
recite his tales, their eyes filled with tears.
They were walking with the Prince in the
beautiful gardens of Heroeum near the sea&ndash;shore,
as he explained his plans to them.
There was much that was wonderful, much
that they could not understand. But they saw
that it was an exploit worthy of the Vikings,
and they joyfully consented to take part in it,
on the understanding that they were to return
with Monas. The two boys were handed over
to the Gothic Prince with the sanction of the
Prefect of the Imperial Bedchamber.</p>

<p>In less than a month the Emperor and his
court were at Antioch, with a powerful and
efficient army encamped outside the town.
Coelred and Lilla agreed together that, if
they returned from their expeditions, they
would wait for each other at Antioch before
starting for Rome. Sivel was already employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
in the mint, receiving practical instruction
in the art of coining the debased
money which bore the name and effigy of
Maurice, and they thought that they could
safely calculate on his being still there when
they returned.</p>

<p>One evening the boys were sitting together
under the shade of some date&ndash;palms outside
the city gate, discussing all the wondrous
sights they had beheld, and their new experiences,
when a great cloud of dust was
seen on the road. Soon afterwards a brilliant
cavalcade came in sight. It literally glittered
under the rays of the setting sun, seeming to
be one sparkling mass of bright weapons and
gorgeous dresses. At its head rode a man in
a long robe of cloth&ndash;of&ndash;gold, with flowing locks,
and a huge globe of some light wicker&ndash;work
gilded, surmounting his silver&ndash;gilt helmet.
After a short parley he was admitted with
his followers, and conducted to quarters near
the palace. It was Khosro Parviz, the King of
Persia, who had been driven from his dominions,
and came to seek aid from the Emperor.</p>

<p>The reception of this King of Kings by
Maurice was magnificent; and he consented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
to employ his army for the restoration of
Khosro. For several days active preparations
were being made, and then there was a second
separation of the English boys. As the army
began its march under the command of Narses,
Coelred, Porlor, and Sivel bade an affectionate
farewell to Lilla and Bassus, who were well
mounted and followed in the general's train.</p>

<p>Next day Athanagild took leave of the
Emperor Maurice, and made sail for Alexandria
with his young English followers, and
half a dozen Gothic soldiers who had been the
loyal and attached followers of his father.
They were to travel from Alexandria to Myos
Hormos on the Red Sea, where Monas had
promised to meet them with a vessel prepared
for the long voyage. When the Prince fled
from Toledo, he had taken with him a large
amount of gold and jewels sewn up in belts,
which he had carefully kept by causing his
servants to wear them, and which would now
enable him to equip his expedition. He and
his young friends were in high spirits when the
long line of white buildings, the tall Pharos
rising above them, and the rows of palm trees
announced that Alexandria was in sight.</p>

<div class="break">

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">A SON OF ALARIC</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The sun was pouring down its dazzling rays
on rocks and sand, and on the expanse of
intensely blue sea. There was nothing to
relieve the eye except a line of white huts,
and at some distance a grove of date&ndash;palms
surrounding a well. One small vessel was
at anchor. This was Myos Hormos on the
Red Sea. Coelred and Porlor reclined in a
shed roofed with palm leaves, near the well,
while Athanagild and the Goths, drowsy with
the heat, were lying about under the trees.
Mounted on camels, and guided by a servant
of Monas, they had crossed the desert during
the nights, and had arrived on the seventh day
at dawn. They now waited for the coming of
Monas from the town. The boys were much
changed in appearance. Their faces were
bronzed by the sun, their hair close cut, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
large white turbans were wound round their
heads. They were dressed in white, and were
armed with swords, daggers, and spears. A
chatty of fresh water and a little heap of
parched corn on a cloth were between them.</p>

<p>Coelred's eyes were closed. He opened
them drowsily and said, "With my eyes
shut, and the sun making the darkness
almost light, I fancy that I am lying on the
grass, by the brook at Stillingfleet, and almost
hear the voices of Bergliot and Braga, and the
barking of dear old Shuprak at the top of the
hill." Porlor looked at his brother, whose
eyes were filling with tears, and lovingly
stroked his cheek. "My thoughts and dreams
are ever with our loved ones, like yours, dear
Coelred. But we must keep wide awake for
the next few days," and he shook his brother
by the shoulder. "We have seen enough of
our companions to make that quite clear."
In a very low voice Coelred said, "What
think you of Athanagild?" "The Gothic
Prince," replied Porlor, in a whisper, "is a
brave and true warrior, and will keep his
word with us, I am sure. But he is not
gifted with patience or judgment, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
has embarked on an enterprise which requires
both. He acts on sudden impulses, strikes
before hearing a word, and his Goths follow
and obey blindly. There is much to arrange
now that needs forethought and care, and I
feel that, although we are so many years
younger, the success of this voyage will
depend upon our conduct, and upon the
character of the captain and pilot of whom
we know nothing. In truth we have had
several affrays since we landed in Egypt,
and have escaped death or imprisonment
mainly by good fortune, and all have been
due to the quick temper of our chief." "We
cannot always guide our own thoughts and
actions," mused Coelred, "how much less
those of our companions. So we must often
leave all to chance; yet there are those who
take all these things into account, weigh them,
and give each its just value, and who can
then offer sage counsel; and you are one, my
Porlor." "I do try hard to think out the
points on which our lives and fortunes
depend," said the younger boy; "and truly
I do so because one who is dearer to me than
my own life shares my fate." They both sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
up and wound their arms round each other in
a brotherly embrace. As they did so they
became aware of people approaching the palm
grove, whose figures stood out clear against
the sky. The party consisted of an erect old
man with a white beard, and some black
servants. "If I mistake not, this is the pilot
and guide of whom we know nothing, and
concerning whom it imports us much to know
a great deal," said Porlor. At the same
moment Coelred cried out&mdash;"Prince Athanagild,
a visitor approaches."</p><br />

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The Prince and his Goths sprang to their
feet as the old man came under the shade of
the trees and made a low obeisance. He
introduced himself as the pilot and master
who had undertaken to supply the vessel,
load her with a suitable cargo, and convey
the Prince to India. Funds had been duly
received through the Imperial physician
Alexander, and such merchandise had been
purchased as there would be a demand for
at the Indian port, and had been conveyed
across the desert. The vessel was built at
Adulis, and was owned by Monas. "Good,"
said the Prince; "we will sail to&ndash;day." "That
cannot be," objected the old man, "for the
ship is not ready and the cargo is not on
board." "How long will be the delay?"
"A week at least," was the answer, "and I
have a long report to make." "I cannot
rest here, and I cannot listen, old man. I
must be at work. Action, not words, for me.
I and my followers will hunt out these Arabs
of the desert of whom I hear, and try their
mettle while you make the ship ready."
Monas protested, and explained the extreme
danger of such a proceeding. "In ordinary
times," he said, "there is nothing to plunder
at Myos Hormos. But if the news gets
abroad that a ship is loading or unloading,
then indeed are the vultures gathered together.
Clouds of Arabs cover the sands, and pounce
down if the merchants have not sufficient
force to resist them. I believe that our
secret is well kept, yet the sight of you and
your followers careering over the desert will
at once bring the marauders about our ears."
But the Prince would not listen to reason.
He caused his led horses to be saddled, and
his camels to be loaded with food and water,
and set out with his Goths in the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in search of adventures. His last words
to Monas were&mdash;"These Counts" (<i>Comites</i>),
pointing to Coelred and Porlor, "are my
lieutenants, and will act for me. Their
wishes are my wishes, their orders my orders."
So saying, this knight&ndash;errant rode away.</p>

<p>Monas held up his hands with astonishment
at such madness. He turned round to look
at the lieutenants, and saw a boy of fifteen
and another of thirteen; well grown and
intelligent, no doubt, and one struck him
as possessing sagacity above his years, but
both very young. "Counts!" he said aloud;
but to himself, "Lieutenants! The Holy
Saints protect us!" and he again held up
his hands, with a half&ndash;despairing gesture.</p>

<p>This conversation had been carried on in
Greek. The boys came forward, and Porlor
requested the old man to make his report,
and enable them to enter upon the duties
with which their friend Athanagild had entrusted
them. They did this with such a
quiet assumption of command, and with such
combined dignity and courtesy, that Monas
almost ceased to feel the incongruity of such
very juvenile Counts taking the command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the enterprise, and at once entered upon his
explanations and reports, with which he had
come for submission to Athanagild.</p>

<p>Monas, in early life, had been a companion
of the better&ndash;known merchant and monk
Cosmas in his daring voyages. A native of
Egypt, of Greek descent, his quick wit and
readiness of resource had enabled him to
establish commercial intercourse between ports
of the Red Sea and of the west coast of India,
after his master Cosmas had retired into
monkish seclusion. He had acted as interpreter,
when quite a young man, to the
Indian embassy which brought a present of
an elephant to the Emperor Justinian in 552,
and he had since made several voyages to
India. When the imperial physician applied
to his ancient friend Cosmas, on the subject
of the wish of the Gothic Prince to make a
voyage to India, and forwarded a supply of
money, the matter was placed in the hands
of Monas. For Cosmas had quite retired
from worldly concerns, though the famous
geographer still survived, in a cell situated
in a secluded oasis near Myos Hormos.
Although the disciple was also contemplating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
a retirement to a monastic cell in imitation
of his master, he consented to undertake one
more voyage. He owned more than one
vessel at Adulis, and the most seaworthy was
brought up to Myos Hormos, while the
articles well known to Monas as finding a
ready sale in the Indian ports were purchased
in the markets of Alexandria, sent
up the Nile to Thebes, and conveyed across
the desert with as little delay as possible, in
the hope that the Arab marauders would not
hear that a ship was being loaded at the
deserted port of Myos Hormos.</p>

<p>When Coelred and Porlor walked down to
the beach, they found the ruins of a considerable
town, and three or four sheds consisting
of stone walls with roofs of palm leaves. The
small cargo was stored in them, and the crew
of tall blacks was loading a boat with bales.
The boys, accompanied by Monas, went on
board the vessel with the first load, and
found her to be a craft the like of which
they had never before seen. She had a
half&ndash;deck and a small cabin. Her build was
like that of the <i>pathamars</i> on the Malabar
coast, the planks being neatly secured to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
other with knotted ropes, and she had two
masts with lateen sails. Water was stored in
large chatties carefully lashed to the ship's
side, and the food, all bread and vegetables,
was in sacks. The boys inquired whether
there was any danger of an attack from
Arabs, and Monas said that he hoped the
wild young Prince would return the next
evening at latest, in which case he was not
likely to have encountered Arabs, and the
risk would be averted.</p>

<p>Monas further said that it was necessary
that the young Counts, as he called the boys,
should visit the great navigator and geographer
in his seclusion; and it was agreed that they
should travel during the night. A short refreshing
sleep was followed by a bathe in the
sea when the sun set. Coelred, Porlor, and
Monas then mounted their camels and proceeded
over the desert in a south&ndash;westerly
direction. After travelling for several hours,
at dawn they came to a small grove of date&ndash;palms,
where a stone cell of some size had
been built, with a few sheds round it. This
was the place to which Cosmas had retired to
end his days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>On entering the grove, the visitors found
a man in extreme old age, seated outside his
cell almost in a state of coma. He had a
long white beard, and must have been upwards
of ninety years old. When Monas told
him that his visitors were the adventurers
who wished to undertake a voyage to India,
he aroused himself. "They must consult me
first," he said in a feeble but clear voice.
"They must rest here and listen to what I
can tell them. I am Cosmas," he continued,
addressing the boys, "and my title is <i>Indicopleustes</i>,
for I sailed to India. Give them
food, and let them sit and listen to my words."
Dates were set before them by a servant, and
the garrulous old man continued to relate
the story of his life. "I have been, in the
years long gone by, a merchant who navigated
the Erythraean Sea, and reached the distant
ports of India. I knew the seasons, and
taught Monas when the winds blew which
would take us to India, and when he must
spread his sails to return. It is said that
Hippalus, in the days of Claudius the
Emperor, first discovered the constancy of
the winds in their seasons. It is true. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the credit is mine of making this knowledge
useful to the world. Now the rich products
of India are sold in markets within the
dominions of our Emperor. This is due to
me. I know all the emporia and how to
reach them. I was impelled by the desire of
knowledge more than by gain, though there
was gain. I discovered the royal seat of white
marble at Adulis. It is consecrated to Ares.
There are images of Heracles and Hermes
sculptured on it, and Greek letters are written
on every side. Monas helped me to copy
the inscription, which was caused to be put
there by the great King Ptolemy Euergetes.
It is all in my second book. You have read
my great work?" he asked. The boys answered
that they could not read. "You must
learn," he went on. "It is necessary that
you should read my great work. It is in
twelve books, and is entitled <i>Christian Topography</i>.
When my career was finished as a
merchant going to and fro, I devoted myself
to God and became a monk. Then I wrote
my great book. In it I have confuted Ptolemy
and all the Pagans. I have proved that the
earth is a flat surface. It is an oblong plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
twice as long from east to west as from north
to south, and the holy city of Jerusalem is in
the centre. The whole is enclosed by an
ocean. I have proved it by arguments from
Scripture, from the Fathers, from testimony,
and from reason. There are many copies of
my great work in the monasteries, in libraries,
and in palaces. The Pagans are confuted."
Porlor said that he would be glad if the holy
monk would tell them about the voyage to
India. "I am waiting for God to call me to
begin a longer voyage," was the answer.
"Monas knows all. I taught him." Cosmas
had tired himself, and began to doze. The
old man was not long for this world. He
had done his work, which was to throw back
science for centuries. The interview with old
Cosmas Indicopleustes then came to an end,
and the boys took their leave. They reached
Myos Hormos a little after sunset, and were
disappointed to hear that there was no news
of Athanagild.</p>

<p>During the next few days the loading continued,
but there was no sign of the Prince.
At last he appeared alone, and wounded. He
had had his wish. He had come upon a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
party of Arabs near a well in the desert, and
at once attacked them. All his Goths were
killed, and he received a spear&ndash;thrust, but the
Arabs had not known the extent of the losses
they had inflicted, and retreated under cover
of the night. He thought, however, that he
had been followed by one or two horsemen,
perhaps more, and he knew not whither he
was going, but his horse had brought him
back to the port. He was faint from loss of
blood. Monas declared that they would be
attacked before morning, and he took the
Prince on board the vessel to examine his
wound.</p>

<p>Coelred and Porlor, after a consultation,
made the black sailors build a sort of sconce
or small fort with some of the remaining bales
and other materials, with an angle pointing
landwards, and the two ends resting on the
sea when it was high tide. They also dug a
trench outside in the sand, into which the
water flowed. The remaining merchandise
was brought inside this extemporary intrenchment,
and the loading proceeded through the
night. It was calm and the moon was up.
A little before dawn Coelred, who was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
watch, thought he saw dark figures cautiously
creeping round the huts. The boat happened
to be alongside the vessel, and there were only
a few men and Porlor on shore. Coelred
aroused them, and they all stood to their
arms, when a sudden rush was made by a
number of Arabs. The two boys stood side
by side at the angle, with the sailors supporting
them. Luckily it was high tide. There
was a desperate struggle for the fort. The
foremost assailants were hurled back by the
young Englishmen with their spears. The
brothers then drew their swords and began an
unequal fight, supported by their men, who
behaved well. More of the enemy came to
the attack from behind the huts, and began
to scale the enclosure. All would have been
lost if, at that moment, the boat had not
touched the sand. The boys retreated fighting,
and were seized by their own people as
the boat was shoved off. The marauders
secured a small portion of the cargo, with the
loss of several of their number. Two of the
crew were also killed. As soon as Coelred
and Porlor were on board, Monas weighed
and made sail before a light northerly breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince's wound proved to be mortal.
The loss of blood had been great, there was
much exhaustion, and inflammation set in.
The boys nursed him tenderly. On the third
day he felt that his end was near. Porlor
was supporting him, while Coelred held a
cool bandage on his forehead. Monas had
some skill, but the case was beyond human
aid. He stood looking down on the little
scene, amazed at the madness which had led
to such consequences. "Farewell, my friends,"
said the Prince; "my folly nearly ended your
lives as well as my own. You have become
dear to me. I hoped that you would have
been my companions in arms, and that we
might have carved out an empire together.
I saw that you were true and brave, worthy
to be the comrades of one who is of the blood
of Alaric." He paused, and his voice became
weaker. He finished what he wished to say
with difficulty. "I was driven from my
country. Like you, I desired to return. One
pleasure is left me. I can give you the means
of going home." He looked at Coelred, whose
cool hand, damped with water from a chatty,
was on his forehead. "Take off my belt," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
said. The boy hesitated. "Take it. I would
see it round your waist." Coelred gently unfastened
the embroidered leathern belt, which
was heavy, and did with it as the dying man
had told him. Athanagild smiled as if contented.
"Old man," he said, with difficulty
turning to Monas, "thou art my witness
that I leave all I possess to my young Counts.
I charge thee to safeguard them." He closed
his eyes as Monas bowed low before him in
token of assent. After a long pause the
Prince touched the belt and said, in his corrupt
Greek, "I there place the treasure close
packed in secrecy. Farewell." (<i>Ufaireo dia
malki tote.</i>) These were his last words. The
boys never forgot them, and ever afterwards
used the first word, which they pronounced
"<i>uvaru</i>" for a secret hiding&ndash;place. Athanagild
did not speak again, and passed away
during the night.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brightly, and bathing
the calm expanse of water with a silvery light,
when the old man and the two young boys,
with tears in their eyes, committed the remains
of this impulsive and generous son of
Alaric to the deep.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">UJJAYANI</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The sea was like molten silver. The burning
sun blazed pitilessly down on the little vessel,
which was motionless. The northerly breeze
reckoned upon by Monas had failed him.
They had been becalmed for days, and the
water was running short. All day the boys
were stretched out under a rough awning of
palm leaves, panting for breath. The sky
was like a dome of burnished steel. One
night Porlor watched the northern horizon,
and saw a bank of clouds rising, which he
pointed out to the old pilot and to his
brother. Soon cat's&ndash;paws were seen along the
surface of the sea. Monas said there would
be a breeze in the morning. But their water
would not last them, unless they replenished
at some well on the Arabian coast; yet this
was a very perilous proceeding, for the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
side of the Red Sea was infested by savage
robbers. There was, however, no alternative,
and as soon as the breeze filled his sails,
Monas steered for a port called Jidda, 320
miles south of Myos Hormos. They came to
off a grove of palm trees, which denoted the
presence of wells, on a bright moonlight night.
A short distance to the south there were a
few scattered huts. When dawn broke they
could see that the wells were in possession of
armed men. Monas feared to land, but the
boys declared they would die fighting rather
than die of thirst. Well armed, and accompanied
by half a dozen of the crew, Coelred
and Porlor took the boat, landed, and boldly
advanced towards the wells. They were met
half&ndash;way by a solitary Arab, who stood in the
path uttering the word "Bismillah." He was
a powerful young man, about five years older
than Coelred, in a long camel's&ndash;hair cloth, with
the hood secured round his head by a green
band. His complexion was bronzed, nose
aquiline, lips rather thick, and he had piercing
black eyes. He held a long spear in his right
hand. Coelred said in Greek that they must
have water. The young Arab replied in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the same language that the wells were in his
possession. He said that he was Muhammad,
the son of Abdallah, servant of Abu Taleb,
one of the chiefs of the Koraish of Mekka.
He was commanding an expedition against
the robbers who attacked the caravans of
Mekka, and had defeated them and driven
them from the wells of Jidda. They should
have water if they paid for it&mdash;let the master
of the ship come to him. Coelred sent the
boat back for old Monas, and the English lads
stood facing the Arab youth, all leaning on
their spears. Few more words passed between
them. The Arab gazed at the young Englishmen
with unconcealed admiration, and the
lads scanned the features of the strange being
before them with feelings of curiosity and
interest which they could not have explained.
Monas was very agreeably surprised to find a
law&ndash;maintaining force at the wells, instead of
the cut&ndash;throats he expected. It was soon
arranged that the vessel should be watered
and replenished with some provisions, in
exchange for six bales of cloth. This occupied
the rest of the day. Young Muhammad
and the English lads rested under the shade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The Arab's knowledge of Greek merely enabled
him to strike bargains, and he could
not converse, so that the time was passed, for
the most part, in friendly silence. The
undefinable feeling of interest which took
possession of the boys when they first encountered
this extraordinary man was increased
as they sat near him. The expression
of his countenance changed frequently, but
was always remarkable. His eyes were bright
and eager while he bargained with Monas;
they had a soft and gentle look when they
rested on the truthful faces of his companions;
then again they once or twice flashed a look
of fierce anger, apparently without cause.
But what the boys noticed with most interest
was that far&ndash;away, abstracted look which came
into the Arab's eyes as he rested under the
trees, as if he saw things invisible to all
besides himself; and when this strange look
came it lasted long. They had seen something
like it in the Princess Alca, and once
or twice in old Monas. But there was something
in the Arab's look which was peculiar
to himself: it was as if madness mingled in
his strange abstraction; and when he shook it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
off, it was with a glance of fury. The boys
were quite absorbed by their companion, and
when Monas called them away the sun was
already on the horizon. They took leave of
each other with solemn courtesy, and an hour
afterwards the vessel was under weigh and
sailing down the Red Sea with a fresh
northerly breeze. The boys talked long
over their encounter with this strange being,
and never forgot it. The makers of England
and the false prophet had this wonderful
meeting before the serious work of their lives
was begun. It taught the English boys to
recognise a man with deep convictions, and
to distinguish between real fanaticism and
fraud. It elevated the fanciful conceptions of
the Arab, and when he dreamt of angels he
saw the faces of Coelred and of Porlor.</p><br />

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">COELRED AND PORLOR ON THEIR WAY TO THE WELLS</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">The breeze continued, the air was cooler,
and Monas said that they would soon reach
their next stopping&ndash;place, the emporium of
Ocelis. By this time he knew the whole
history of his young companions. They had
never thought for a moment of turning back
after the death of the Gothic Prince, but were
quite resolved to complete their adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
before returning to Antioch; and the old
man, without any tie of his own, had become
warmly attached to them. He would give
them the use of his knowledge and experience,
see them safe again on their way home, and
then follow his master Cosmas into monastic
seclusion.</p>

<p>Many a long conversation was held between
the boys and their aged friend during
the long starlight nights, when the little
vessel made her way over the smooth sea to
Ocelis. One night they talked of the young
Arab and his look of abstraction. "It is
the look," said Monas, "which betokens fitness
for a life of seclusion, of devotion to
prayer, and thoughts of eternity. The monks
often have it, and the generation in which I
live is one much given to a monkish life. It
is only in such a life that we can find rest,
safety from hell fire, and that religious truth
without which there is no safety. In Egypt
alone there are now six hundred monasteries,
all maintaining the truth against the errors of
Rome." "And what is the truth?" asked
Porlor. "The truth is," said Monas, "that
Christ existed <i>of</i> two natures, and whosoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
denies it shall for ever be accursed. The
Synod of Chalcedon, when Marcian was
emperor, declared that Christ existed <i>in</i> two
natures, and this wicked heresy is still held
by the priests of Rome, and sends many souls
to hell. Dangers and pitfalls of false doctrine
surround us, and the only safety from them is
in monastic seclusion. Young and old should
fly to the desert." "That will I never do,"
cried Coelred. "My life shall be active and
earnest. I devote it to brave deeds and to
the service of my countrymen." Old Monas
shook his head, but he could not help admiring,
and even approving, the very different
direction to which the hopes and aspirations of
his young friends were turned. They understood
his words, but their minds were not
trained to receive such subtleties. "Does
Muhammad hold the truth," asked Porlor,
"or is he, like us, ignorant of the true nature
of the Son of God? We are ignorant because
what you say is beyond our comprehension.
How is it with that Arab warrior with the
changing eyes?" "The Arab," said Monas,
"is a very young man, and he is a heathen.
But he has been in Christian cities with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
merchants of his tribe, and knows something
of the truth. I talked with him in the shade
while you slept." "We were not asleep,"
protested the boys. "Fast asleep," repeated
Monas, "while I sounded the depths of the
young Arab's mind. He is no ordinary man.
He will either receive the truth and convert
Arabia into a land of saints, or he will be
the mightiest heresiarch with which the world
has ever been cursed, spreading desolation and
moral death over what once was Christendom.
But not in my time," drowsily continued the
old man. Coelred rose to take the helm,
and Porlor followed Monas to the land of
dreams.</p>

<p>It was not often that Monas kept the
boys awake with such serious discourse. He
generally related the stirring events in his
voyages with Cosmas, taught them the rules
of steering by the stars, and told of the famous
book written in the time of the Emperor Nero,
and called the <i>Periplus of the Erythraean
Sea</i>, from which Cosmas gleaned much of the
information which enabled him to make his
voyages successfully. The northerly wind soon
brought them to the emporium of Ocelis, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the strait of Dere, which opens upon the
Erythraean Sea. Here they again took in
water and provisions, proceeding along the
Arabian coast to Kane, a port of considerable
trade, where some of the merchandise was
exchanged for frankincense and aloes. Sailing
onwards to the east, they reached Syagros,
whence, in accordance with the directions laid
down by his master, Monas proceeded to make
his bold voyage across the trackless ocean to
distant India. The south&ndash;west wind, called
Hippalus from the pilot who first attempted
the passage by it, carried the little vessel across
the sea until, in a few days, the coast of Guzerat
was sighted, the mouth of the great river
Narbada was entered, and Monas piloted her
past islands and shoals, and anchored her off
the <i>ghât</i> of the busy port of Barugaza.</p>

<p>Founded by the sage Bhriga, the town of
Barugaza was one of the oldest seaports of
Western India, and was then one of the chief
seats of trade. Its exports were cotton, a kind
of fine calico called <i>báftás</i>, bdellium, and
flowers of the mahina tree. Barugaza is on
an artificial hill 60 feet high overlooking the
river, the only rising ground for many miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
around; for a flat alluvial plain of fertile black
soil stretches away for fifty miles to the foot of
the mountains, covered with crops of cotton
and rice. Here and there a clump of mango
and other fruit trees denoted the position of a
village, and on an island in the Narbada there
was a banyan&ndash;tree with 350 large and 3000
small stems, enclosing a space 700 yards in
circumference.</p>

<p>There was much to astonish, much to
interest, the English lads on first landing at
the <i>ghât</i> of Barugaza. They had seen an
elephant at Alexandria, but everything else
was strange to them; especially the dresses of
the people, the merchants in their snow&ndash;white
robes and red turbans, and the crowds of
coolies with nothing but a <i>dhuti</i> round their
waists, carrying heavy loads, and taking cargoes
on board the boats. Kesava was the name of
the merchant who always acted as agent for
Monas when he brought a cargo to Barugaza;
and this was the fifth time he had made the
voyage, without counting those in which he
accompanied Cosmas. Before they were contaminated
by intercourse with Europeans, the
merchants of India were celebrated for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
probity and fair dealing; and Kesava was a
good specimen of his class. Property could be
entrusted to his care with perfect confidence,
and he took charge of the vessel and the crew,
while Monas and the boys were to convey their
merchandise up country to Ujjayani, one of
the seven sacred cities of the Hindus, the
famous capital of Malwa.</p>

<p>Monas set out on his journey a few days
after his arrival at Barugaza. He and the
boys travelled in open palkis, their bales of
goods were slung on bamboos which were
borne on the shoulders of coolies, and they
were guarded by a well&ndash;equipped body of
fighting men. They travelled up stream,
along the right bank of the Narbada, for 180
miles, to a small town called Mandlesar, where
the river is still 500 yards in width. Thence
the route turned northwards across the Vindhya
Hills for a distance of seventy miles to Ujjayani.
Coelred and Porlor walked across the hills,
travelling from midnight until sunrise, and
on the third day from leaving Mandlesar they
entered the far&ndash;famed capital of Malwa. Along
this road the English lads observed that long
lines of trees were planted to afford shade to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
travellers from the scorching rays of the sun,
while at intervals there were fountains by the
road&ndash;side to enable them to quench their thirst.
Porlor, especially, was deeply impressed with
the excellence of a government which took
such thought for the comfort of its people.</p>

<p>The city of Ujjayani was built on the right
bank of the river Sipra, with <i>ghâts</i> leading
down to the water. It was very extensive,
and contained many grand edifices, besides the
famous temple of Siva and the palace of the
Raja. There were, however, more trees than
houses. Every dwelling had its shady garden
stocked with flowering shrubs, and round the
city there was a broad belt of fruit trees, and
avenues of the sacred <i>vata</i> or peepul trees,
frequented by the Hanuman monkeys. Within
this belt of foliage were the great tanks with
bathing <i>ghâts</i> shaded by clumps of tall trees,
above which rose the spreading fans of the
palmyra palm and the graceful areca; while
<i>palása</i> and <i>tulasi</i> shrubs, with their gorgeous
flowers, concealed the bathers.</p>

<p>The golden age of Hindu literature was the
period when Vikramaditya ruled at Ujjayani
about B.C. 57, and when the "Nava&ndash;ratna" or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
nine gems of literature flourished there. His
dynasty still ruled over Malwa, and in 592
Jayachandra was the Raja. The place was
full of traditions of the hero king, and of his
divine poet Kalidasa, whose immortal works
had the freshness and reality at Ujjayani
which such poems can only really possess at
the place where they were composed. The
bright river Sipra, the flowering groves, the
pretty girls descending the <i>ghâts</i> with lotas on
their heads, the cranes in the paddy swamps&mdash;all
nature reminded the votaries of Kalidasa
that he dwelt at the court of Ujjayani when
he wrote <i>Sakuntala</i>, the <i>Seasons</i>, and the
<i>Cloud Messenger</i>. Peace reigned in Malwa,
but there were threatening clouds on the
northern horizon. Gollas, King of the White
Huns, had overrun Northern India, and terror
repeated marvellous stories of the prowess of
his army, which included 2000 elephants. It
was said that, when he besieged a town, his
soldiers drank all the water in the ditch, and
then marched dry&ndash;shod to beat down the walls.
It was to this conqueror that Athanagild had
contemplated the offer of his sword; but
Coelred and Porlor had no such intention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Ujjayani was to be the remotest point of their
wanderings, whence they were to return homewards.</p>

<p>Monas was busily engaged in exchanging
the merchandise for bales of small bulk, containing
fine calico and muslin, valuable gums,
spices, precious stones, and specie. Among
his acquaintance there was an old Guru named
Govinda, who had travelled far and spoke
Greek. He was a man of profound learning
though of Sudra caste, and was passing the
evening of his days at Ujjayani, occupied in
speculative studies. Govinda had taken a
great fancy for the English lads, whose bright
intelligence and simple truthfulness first attracted
his regard. After their bath in one
of the great tanks, they often passed hours
conversing with the Guru, asking him questions,
and listening to his wonderful discourse.
He was generally in the verandah of a small
garden&ndash;house near a large tank, which was
surrounded by flowering shrubs, and shaded
by a large <i>vata</i> tree. Here the Guru sat, an
old man with a very benevolent expression
and high intellectual forehead, clothed in snow&ndash;white
robes, often with a bundle of reeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
forming a book, and a <i>kalam</i> in his hand.
Coelred and Porlor reclined on a step at his
side, listening eagerly to what he told them.
The boys were in perfect health, being well
cared for by Monas as regards clothing and
protection from the sun and from chills, and
living on a diet of rice and pulses duly seasoned,
on fruits, and milk. They were thus able to
enjoy to the full all the wonders of their
sojourn at Ujjayani.</p>

<p>The Guru had told them many tales of
Hindu gods and heroes. One morning the
boys came from their bath with a quantity of
crimson water&ndash;lilies, and a handful of the
golden&ndash;coloured champaka flower, sacred to
Krishna. This led Govinda to tell them the
story of the <i>avatur</i>, calling Krishna the Son
of God. They, in their turn, related the
legend of Balder, and, after reflecting a while,
the Guru said that Balder and Krishna were
one, and that both were Christ. Remembering
the conversation with Monas, Porlor asked
whether this Son of God with several names,
whom they all worshipped, existed <i>of</i> two
natures or <i>in</i> two natures. "Both," replied
the Guru, and this bold solution appeared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
once to sweep away the motives for religious
disputes which sounded so incomprehensible
to the boys. "Both, for whether of or in
two natures, the incarnation of a deity embraces
and contains, and in fact is, all that
can be expressed by prepositions, and much
more."</p>

<p>Then, descending from such sublime speculations,
he said that he would relate to his young
friends the sequel of the story of the Pandavas,
those princes favoured by Krishna, including
their search for heaven after a long life of
adventures and vicissitudes. The Pandavas
found that all the rewards of this life were
vanity, and that they must seek for higher and
better things. "We must all do likewise
sooner or later, and meanwhile we may reflect
on the story of the Pandavas," he went on.
"There were five princes&mdash;Yudisthira, Arjuna,
Bhima, and the two sons of Madri. They set
out with their wife Draupadi and their dog
Suparaka." "That is the name of our dear old
dog at home!" exclaimed Coelred. "True,"
said the Guru, "for Suparaka is Yama." He
continued&mdash;"The princes, with their beautiful
wife and faithful dog, set out for the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Himalaya Mountains, to find the heaven of
the gods on Mount Meru." "Is not Asgard
the abode of the gods?" interrupted Coelred.
"Asgard is Meru," explained the long&ndash;suffering
Guru; "but few can reach it, trusting in their
own strength. Sins and moral defects prove
fatal to the pilgrims. They toiled on over
scorching plains and snowy mountains, tired
and foot&ndash;sore. Draupadi was the first to fall."
Porlor asked why she should be the first.
"Her love for Arjuna was too great," explained
the Guru. "Next fell one of the sons of
Madri, for he thought that none was equal to
himself; and the other son of Madri followed,
for he had the same fault. Then Arjuna fell,
because he could not fulfil his boast that he
would destroy all his enemies in one day.
Bhima fell, because he cursed his opponents
before he encountered them in fight. Yudisthira
and the dog Suparaka alone reached the gate
of heaven. The Prince was invited by the
gods to enter, but he refused unless Draupadi
and his brothers were also received. He was
assured that they were already there. But he
still refused, unless the faithful dog Suparaka
could bear him company. The gods remonstrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
but Yudisthira was firm. 'Never,
come weal or come woe, will I abandon that
faithful dog.' He prevailed, but when he entered
he found that Draupadi and his brothers were
not in heaven. They cried to him for help
from hell. Yudisthira triumphed in the crowning
trial. He resolved to share the fate of his
dear ones in hell, rather than enjoy heaven
without them. This was the supreme test
applied by the gods. They then showed him
that it was all <i>maya</i> or illusion, and the
brothers, Draupadi, and the dog dwell in
heaven with the gods, in full content of heart
for ever."</p>

<p>Coelred and Porlor talked much over this
story of Yudisthira when they returned that
evening to their home with Monas. They
loved the Pandu prince for standing by the
good dog Suparaka, and they swore that they
would imitate the steadfast loyalty of Yudisthira.</p>

<p>Thus the days passed on, while Monas completed
his business, and the Guru related many
strange tales to the English lads. One day, as
they sat with him, a dark mass of cloud rose
from the southern horizon, and moved rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
northwards across the sky towards the Himalayan
snows. Old Govinda pointed to it, and
said that it reminded him of Kalidasa's poem
of the <i>Cloud Messenger</i>. "Tell us about
it," said both the boys; and he related how
Yaksha was banished for some fault by the
god Kuvera, and was sent to pass the years of
his exile at Ramagiri, near Nagpore, and to
the south of Ujjayani, and of the Vindhyan
Hills. One day he saw a cloud, the herald
of the rainy season, passing to the north, just
as the cloud we now see floats in the same
direction. He prayed to the cloud to take a
message for him, after discharging some of its
moisture.</p>

<p class="pp7">With pinions swifter by the 'minisht store,<br />
Soon over Vindhyan mountains thou wilt soar,<br />
And Reva's rippling stream, whose waters glide<br />
Beneath their feet, without their rush and roar,<br />
In many a rock&ndash;bound channel, summer dried,</p>
<p class="pp8">Like lines of paint that deck an elephant's huge side.</p>

<p class="pn">The cloud passed on to this bright imperial
city of Ujjayani, the pride of all the earth. It
rested on flower&ndash;sweet terraces where women
sit at open casements, while the air of the
morning</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp4">Plays wooingly around the loosened hair<br />
And fevered cheek&mdash;<br />
Then, as it blows o'er Sipra fresh and strong,<br />
Bids all her swans upon the banks prepare<br />
To hail the sunrise.</p>

<p>"The cloud hurries onward on its journey,"
said Porlor, "but whither was Yaksha's message
sent?" "It was sent," said the Guru, "to
Alakà." "To Alca!" exclaimed both the boys,
as they sprang to their feet in astonishment.
Then, seeing the question in Govinda's eyes,
they explained that Alca was the beautiful
Princess of Deira. "We love her more than
anything in the world. She knows everything.
She loves all living things. She can
disclose all the hidden mysteries of nature.
She is our joy, our hope. Oh that the cloud
would take a message to her from us! Shall
we pray to it? Answer us, good Govinda."</p>

<p>The Guru looked at the eager faces of the
boys. He then pondered for a long time. At
last he said&mdash;"The Alakà of our religion is
believed to be the abode or the heaven of the
Gandharva on Mount Meru. The Gandharva
is the being who knows and reveals the secrets
of nature and divine truth, and prepares the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
holy soma juice for the gods." He again
paused to think. "Your northern Princess
Alca is the same as our Alakà, the abode of the
Gandharva of wisdom and truth, the depository
of the secrets of nature. You do well to love
her. Pray then to the cloud and it will take
your message." The boys knelt down, praying
long and fervently to the cloud to take their
message. It was that they were well, that
they had never forgotten her words, that they
would return to her. The Guru assured them
that they had not prayed in vain. They had
never felt so happy since they parted from the
Princess at Aldby.</p>

<p>Not many days afterwards they bade farewell
to the Guru, who had become warmly
attached to them; for Monas had completed
his arrangements, the bales were ready, and
they started on their return journey to Barugaza.
The boys had offered their old friend
a gold ring as a keepsake, which he declined.
But when he saw them for the last time he
gave them a small parcel as an offering for
their Princess. "It contains," he said, "a
very precious gum called bdellium, translucent
and fragrant. It is a trifle by which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
remember me." "We shall never forget you,
dear Guru," exclaimed Coelred; and Porlor declared
that "Bdellium" should be their watchword
and the watchword of their friends for
evermore. Soon Ujjayani and the Guru,
Barugaza and its busy <i>ghât</i>, were but
memories. The north&ndash;east wind was taking
their little vessel homewards again across the
Erythraean Sea.</p>

<p>One night, as old Monas sat aft by the
steering oar, with Coelred and Porlor near
him, he asked the boys what they had been
told by the Guru. Porlor was full of his
praises, and repeated the stories of Krishna
and of the Pandus; but something held the
brothers back from mentioning the Cloud
Messenger to the aged pilot. They declared
that the Guru was the wisest, the most learned,
and the most religious man in the world, and
that he was beloved by God. "The strange
and incomprehensible questions over which
others quarrel for days and years, the Guru
sees through and settles with a word. He is
generous, and says that all men, more or less,
are in the right way." Monas shook his head.
"My friend Govinda," he said, "is learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and good. It grieves me to the heart that he
will assuredly be burnt in hell fire for ever and
ever. Yet that must be his fate, for he is unsound
on all points of doctrine." It was on
the tip of Coelred's tongue to say he would go
where the Guru went; but he checked himself,
for the boys loved old Monas, and made it a
point not to anger or annoy him. "Beware,"
he continued, "how you allow plausible falsehoods
to sink into your hearts. You are very
young and will be surrounded by dangers.
May the Lord watch over you!"</p>

<p>On another night Monas explained their
position to his young friends. "Thanks to
Prince Athanagild," he said, "you are very
rich. Your property consists of small bales
easily carried but of great value, and of gold
coins and gems. The crew will be amply
recompensed by a present of the vessel and a
generous distribution of money. We will land
at Berenike, to which port the voyage is much
shorter than to Myos Hormos. There camels
can be procured, and the journey to the Nile
will occupy three days. I will accompany you
to Alexandria and see you embarked for
Antioch. For myself I need nothing. I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to the cell of my old master, who must now
be dead, where I shall end my days happily, in
prayer and in the contemplation of the true
nature of the incarnate Word. Your destiny is
very different. I am on the verge of the grave.
You are entering upon life. You are brave
and true. May the blessing of God be with
you!"</p>

<p>It was very grateful to the old pilot to
receive the warm thanks of his young friends,
knowing how true and genuine they were; and
the voyage passed pleasantly. The plans of
Monas were admirably arranged. The crew
was satisfied, the journey across the desert
and the voyage down the Nile were performed
without accident, and when Coelred and Porlor
left Alexandria in the vessel that was to convey
them to the port of Antioch, the last thing
they saw was the white cloth with which old
Monas waved his farewell from the Pharos.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">IRAN</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Sivel was a very intelligent and quick&ndash;witted
boy, and he rapidly learnt all his companions
could teach him in the treasury office at
Antioch and in the mint. He was able to
read and write, and had even tried his hand
on the dies for stamping coins. The decadence
of art had been very rapid since the days of
Gallienus. All attempts at portraiture on
the coins had disappeared, though there was
still a head, and an angel with orb and cross
on the reverse. It was not beyond the
powers of a clever boy like Sivel to tool
the inscriptions, and even to copy the rough
effigy of the good Emperor. Not a few of
the rude letters traced on Byzantine money
of this period are the work of our English
boy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p class="px">
<span class="smcap">ti mavricivs imp an ix cos<br />

</p>

<p class="pn">or</p>

<p class="px">
<span class="smcap">dn mavric tiber pf avg</span>;<br />
</p>

<p class="pn">and he was thus busily employed when the
news spread that troops from the Persian war
were returning. Sivel lived, with several
Greek clerks in the employment of the Count
of the Sacred Largesses, in a large room opening
on a court which formed part of the palace.
As he worked one day, two tall forms stood in
the doorway, and in another moment the
delighted boy was wrapped in the tight embraces
of Lilla and Bassus, who had returned
unhurt from the war, and with license to proceed
on their own affairs to Rome. Many
days had not elapsed before Coelred and
Porlor, with their small but precious bales,
also reached the Syrian capital and found a
safe place&mdash;an "<i>uvaru</i>" they called it&mdash;in
which to bestow their goods for the time. The
lads were beside themselves with joy at meeting
once more, and they agreed that all, including
Sivel, should embark in the first vessel bound
for Brundusium.</p>

<p>They longed to hear each other's stories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and when Porlor had related the particulars of
the wonderful voyage to India and back, Lilla
promised, with the help of his friend Bassus,
to describe what they had seen during the
Persian war. On the next evening they
assembled under the shade of the grove of
palm trees, outside the city gate, whence they
had beheld the arrival of Khosro Parviz before
their adventures began. Bassus first explained
the cause of the war. "On the dethronement
and death of Hormazd IV., King of Persia,"
he said, "there was great confusion. Bahram,
the ablest of the Persian generals, gained over
the army and seized the government, while
the King's son, Khosro Parviz, took refuge in
Roman territory. We all witnessed his arrival
at Antioch from this very spot, and we know
that the Emperor graciously resolved to restore
the fugitive prince to the throne of his
ancestors. He was influenced in making this
decision partly by policy, but mainly, it is
believed, by the generous dictates of his imperial
nature. Our master in the art of war,
the great General Narses, received the commands
of the Emperor Maurice to execute his
orders, and he planned the campaign with consummate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
skill. It was known that Bahram,
with the Persian army, was posted in the
Mesopotamian plain beyond the river Tigris,
and not far from the foot of the mountains.
Narses resolved that the Roman forces should
enter Persia in two divisions. The General
himself, accompanied by the King of Persia,
led the main body from Antioch to the Tigris,
while a Roman contingent, under the command
of John, the Prefect of Armenia, was to create
a diversion by breaking into the northern
Persian province of Azerbijan. For Narses
had carefully studied the science of tactics and
evolutions under the eye of the Emperor, who
was himself the author of twelve books on the
military art. You saw the army commence
its march, and we parted in the earnest hope
that this happy day of meeting again would
not be long deferred. Lilla must now tell you
of our march."</p>

<p>The thread of the story was then taken up
by the fearless son of Guthlaf. "As pages of
the General," said Lilla, "we rode behind him,
and encamped near his tent. For several
days we had to traverse a vast desert, and
we were often parched with thirst; but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
length we reached the river Tigris, passing
over it near a great mound which, we were
told, covers the ruins of the most ancient
city in the world, called Nineveh. Crossing
the river, our General made three rapid
marches to overtake the Persians, who were
encamped at the foot of the mountains. Then
the wisdom of the strategy of Narses was
made clear. Hearing of the march of the
Armenian contingent, the Persian General
feared lest it should fall on his rear, and
he began a rapid march to the northward
to attack it. But the Prefect John had
strict orders to avoid an encounter; and
eventually Bahram made a countermarch to
cover the city of Canzaca, towards which
Narses was steadily advancing. Leaving the
plain, our way led us through the mountains
of Media, to Sirgàn, on the plain of Ushneï,
where a junction was formed with John's
contingent. Three days afterwards a great
battle was fought in a hilly country. For
a time the Roman infantry fell back before
the vigorous charges of Persian horse, and
Narses himself dashed into the thick of the
battle. We fought by his side, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
victory was won the General was so pleased
with us that he gave us separate commands
of infantry companies. Next morning Bahram
continued his retreat over the mountains,
closely pursued by us, and at night we
pitched our camp close to the Persian position.
Still retreating, the Persians descended
into the plain in which their great city of
Canzaca is built on a high rock. Here the
final and decisive battle was fought. Bassus
and I led on our men, and were long engaged
in desperate encounters side by side. At
last we saw the enemy flying in all directions.
But we were too exhausted to follow them,
and rested for three days on the battle&ndash;field.
Our General then occupied the Persian city
of Canzaca.</p>

<p>"Khosro Parviz was overjoyed. Our army
had made him once more King of Kings,
or <i>Malkân Malkâ</i>. He declared that the
Emperor Maurice was his father, requested
a contingent of the Romans to remain in
his service, and promised great rewards to
the rest. For a short time we were posted
in the wonderful city where the people
worship fire which has been kept burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
for 700 years." Porlor and Coelred had both
been too absorbed in the story of the campaign
to interrupt with questions, but now
Porlor asked whether fire was really the god
of those people. "Yes," said Bassus, "we
saw them worshipping before it. Canzaca
is on a hill which rises high above the plain,
with a steep acclivity to the north and west,
and a sloping approach from the east. The
brow of this hill is crowned by a circlet of
strong stone walls 12 feet wide, extending
for a great distance, with an arched gateway
also of massive hewn stone, leading into the
town. In the highest part of the town there
is a lake, 300 paces round, with exquisitely
clear water of a deep blue colour, which has
no bottom. And now I come to your question
about the fire. Near the lake there stands a
fire&ndash;temple&mdash;<i>pyraeum</i> the Greeks call it. Built
of bricks and cement, its walls are of great
thickness, and a narrow vaulted passage surrounds
the central chamber. This chamber
has a great arch on each of its sides, and is
surmounted by a circular dome on which the
stars of heaven are painted. A silver moon
is on the highest point. In the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
this chamber is the altar with the sacred
fire. We have seen the King, Khosro
Parviz, enthroned there, surrounded by emblems
of the sun and moon, with the golden
globe on his head, while all his people prayed
to the flame on the altar."</p>

<p>"We used to sit on the walls," said Lilla,
"and look over a vast extent of country
bounded by distant mountains. At our feet
there was a winding rocky ridge, the height of
two men and 80 paces long, called 'the Dragon.'
We were told that the monster was coming
open&ndash;mouthed to devour the city when it was
suddenly transformed into stone by the potent
spell of the signet ring of an ancient king
they call Solomon. Certainly it was lying on
the plain before us, like a winding serpent of
stone. We were offered commands by the
King of Persia, which we declined, and the
General then said that we deserved some
reward and might name it. So we asked for
license to go to Rome, where friends urgently
needed our presence, which was granted.
Narses said that he was sorry to part with
us when we took leave, and we set out with a
small escort. We had to cross the Median<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
mountains to reach the plains of Mesopotamia,
and in the pass my Bassus was so badly hurt
by a fall with his horse that we had to
remain at a place called Sideh for several
days." "Did they also worship fire in that
place?" asked Porlor. "No," said Lilla, "they
had a stranger worship. They believe in an
ancient bird called the Simùrg, which has
been alive since the world began. Passing
to and fro over the earth from the beginning,
the Simùrg has seen everything. It therefore
knows everything, and is a bird of great
wisdom. Its counsel is sought for, but it
is seldom seen, and its abode is believed to
be on the mountain peak of Demavend. They
worship a figure of the Simùrg made of silver,
which we saw. It was on a raised platform,
and has a swelling breast, small head, and
wide&ndash;spreading tail. Two lamps are always
burning before it, and close by there is a jug
filled with water, to be used as a spell for the
sick and afflicted when the Simùrg cannot be
consulted in person. As soon as Bassus was
well enough we left Sideh, descended into the
plain, and, after a long and tedious journey,
arrived at Antioch without further accident."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"How wonderful are the numbers of gods!"
observed Porlor. "We have found people
not only worshipping the Son of God under
many names, but also bowing down to snakes,
cows, and monkeys. Now you tell us that
there are people who worship a flame of fire,
and others whose belief is in an ancient bird.
Many of their creeds are incomprehensible,
but the Princess Alca will explain it all to
us when we go home." Coelred warmly
thanked Lilla and Bassus for the story of
their campaign, which had been of absorbing
interest to him, and for telling him and
Porlor of all the wonders they had seen. A
very happy evening had been passed under
the palm trees.</p>

<p>The subsequent days were occupied in
preparations for the voyage to Brundusium.
A vessel had been hired at Seleucia and was
ready to sail, when a great calamity overtook
the friends. Little Sivel was missing. He had
not been seen since the evening when Lilla
and Bassus related their adventures. The
other lads had taken leave of him in the
street, but his companions in the treasury
said that he never came home. Several days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
were wasted in a vain search. At last Lilla
remembered that, while passing through a
crowd in the <i>agora</i> the day after his arrival,
he for a moment caught sight of a face which
reminded him of Mystacon. The incident had
passed from his memory, being full of other
exciting thoughts at the time. "I see it all!"
exclaimed Porlor. The rest turned to him for
an explanation, but he declared there was no
time to explain, and that they must hurry
down to the port of Seleucia. Porlor instituted
inquiries at once, through the agent for their
vessel, and sure enough Mystacon the merchant
had been there. He had sailed, on his way
to Rome, three days before. Further inquiry
elicited the fact that some one, muffled up in
cloths and gagged, had been carried on board.</p>

<p>"We are too late!" exclaimed Porlor. "We
must follow quickly to Rome and effect the
rescue there. For the villainy is unmasked.
Mystacon has seen Pamphronius, who has
offered large sums for the recovery of his
slaves. He has found out that our Sivel
was at Antioch, with his value greatly increased
owing to his acquired knowledge and
well&ndash;known ability, of which every one talks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
He has kidnapped our boy and taken him to
Rome, with the object of extorting a heavy sum
from Pamphronius, and he will probably keep
Sivel concealed until it is paid." They were
all wild with rage. "To the rescue! to the
rescue!" they shouted. "Death to Mystacon
and Pamphronius!" Their preparations were
soon made. Next day the captain and crew
were on board, the anchor was up, and the vessel
was bowling along before a fresh easterly
breeze. But it was a long stern chase.</p>

<p>The lads held many consultations during
the voyage. Great caution would be necessary,
for they were resolved not only to
rescue Sivel, but also to kill Mystacon, and
perhaps Pamphronius. Otacilia, the widow of
Symmachus Boethius, who had always been
very kind to Coelred and Porlor, and disliked
Pamphronius, had manumitted all her
husband's slaves. This news had reached
Antioch. Coelred and Porlor, in order to
be close to the scene of action, would therefore
seek, and felt sure of obtaining, hospitality
in the great rambling villa of the departed
Symmachus. Lilla and Bassus would take
up their quarters, as imperial officers, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
lodgings within the old Prætorian camp.
Their friends at the monastery would be
eager to help as soon as the news was told
them. Then a watch must be kept on the
Pamphronian villa, while Lilla was to visit
his old master, and ascertain whether Sivel
was already there. All the haunts of Mystacon
were also to be searched, and further
details were to be settled hereafter, as they
must depend on the course of events.</p>

<p>Thus did these lads rack their brains to
devise the surest way of rescuing their beloved
companion. Coelred and Porlor were
rich, and easily defrayed the expenses of the
vessel, and of posting rapidly from Brundusium
to Rome. It was early in the year 595 that
the four lads returned. Six years had passed
since the mortifying scene in the slave&ndash;market.
Lilla and Coelred had now reached the age
of eighteen, Porlor was sixteen years old.
Both Coelred and Porlor were hospitably
received by Otacilia, as they anticipated, and
the heroes from Persia were lodged in the old
camp. Next day they all hurried to greet
and to consult with their comrades in the
monastery of St. Andrew.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">THE RESCUE OF SIVEL</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Once more the little society of English boys
was assembled at its old trysting&ndash;place under
the cypress trees, near the <i>navicula</i>, on the
Caelian Hill&mdash;all but Sivel. When the first
transports of joy at meeting again were over,
they gazed on each other and rejoiced at the
changes they saw, from weak boys to be sold
and beaten, to powerful young warriors who
were able to defend themselves. Forthere
was nearly mad with rage and anxiety when
he heard of the abduction of his young cousin.
He had become a strong and muscular youth,
a most formidable antagonist, as impulsive as
ever, and otherwise unchanged&mdash;a vigorous foe,
but a true and faithful friend. Little Godric
was still a boy. Hereric had grown into a
youth of singular grace and beauty. He was
now sixteen, and he had an air of cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and breeding, due partly to his high rank,
but also to the knowledge he had acquired.
He could read and write, and had become a
sincere Christian. If he had a fault, it was
that he relied too much on the probity of
others, and was easily deceived by designing
men. Forthere and Godric were devoted to
the Atheling, as indeed were all his companions.
No one could know the Deiran
Prince without loving him. To the sons
of Seomel and to Lilla he was almost a
brother.</p>

<p>Hereric had startling news to tell. He
had passed most of his time studying under
Laurentius in the monastery of St. Andrew.
But Forthere and Godric, refusing to work
at books, were sent to Monte Cassiano, where
they were employed in the fields or at the
works connected with the extension of the
monastery. They were often in trouble,
owing to their decided aversion for the
<i>Regula Monachorum</i> of St. Benedict; and
they had recently been brought back to the
Caelian Hill.</p>

<p>Gregory had not forgotten his intention to
introduce Christianity into England, the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the beautiful children in the market&ndash;place.
Three had been brought up in the monastery
on the Caelian, and one at least would now
make an excellent interpreter. He resolved
to entrust the mission to his prior of St.
Andrew, whose reward was to be the bishopric
of the new diocese. Augustine was to be
accompanied by Laurentius and Peter, Hereric
and his two companions, and several monks
and attendants. Letters were written to the
Queens Fredegonda and Brunehaud for protection
while passing through their dominions;
and to Vergilius, the Bishop of Arles, to bespeak
hospitality. Brunehaud promised also
to provide an interpreter. Hereric had been
told of the mission, and was, of course, delighted
at so good an opportunity of returning
home, provided that all his companions were
equally favoured. But as the day for starting
approached, the monks showed great repugnance
to being employed on such a service.
They were terrified, and although Augustine
was not so faint&ndash;hearted, he looked upon the
undertaking as being full of danger. The
truth was that Forthere had been telling the
monks such stories about England as made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
their hair stand on end. The time was very
near; for the departure of the mission was to
take place on the very next day, the 21st of
July 596.</p>

<p>When all the news had been exchanged,
the boys were long in consultation. The
plans for the discovery and rescue of Sivel
were laid with care and circumspection. But
Forthere was torn different ways. He could
not endure leaving Rome with his adopted
brother still in the hands of the villain
Mystacon; yet his devotion for the Atheling
made it equally hard to quit the mission and
remain. Hereric settled the question. "Forthere,
my more than brother, your duty is
clear. Sivel is the adopted son of your
valorous father, Brand of Ulfskelf. You must
follow the quest for him until his rescue is
achieved. The loss to me is greater than I
can tell you. But our Godric is growing to
be a man, and a brave one. He will be my
faithful companion and true soldier in your
absence." Young Godric's face flushed with
pleasure, while Hereric and Forthere clasped
each other in a long, silent embrace. "But,"
added the Atheling, as he gazed into Forthere's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
eyes, "you must follow the rede of Porlor, and
the guidance of Coelred and Lilla. Strike
when they give the signal, but not before.
Your blow is strong and sure. Let it fall at
the appointed time, and not too suddenly, my
Forthere. God bless you all, and may our
next meeting be in our own land, with Sivel in
our midst!"</p>

<p>It was clear that, if the boys accomplished all
they intended, Rome would be too hot to hold
them. Their course of action must be guided
by events, but their general plan was to have
horses always ready at the Symmachan villa,
to overpower the guard at one of the gates
when their work was done, and to join the
army of the Lombard King. Thence they
would make their way, by fair means or foul,
to their native land. Coelred prevailed upon
Hereric to take a good supply of money, and
the Atheling also undertook to convey the
small but precious bales from India, as part
of his own baggage. It was the only chance
of their reaching England.</p>

<p>Next day the mission left Rome. Pope
Gregory offered up prayers, said mass at St.
Peter's, and gave the monks his blessing. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
attempt was made to oblige Forthere to go
when he refused. A more woebegone set of
wretches than the monks of this mission could
not be conceived. They looked miserable and
terror&ndash;stricken. Augustine was supported by
the importance and responsibility of his position,
Laurentius and Peter were good men
and true, but the rest were very poor
creatures. Hereric and Godric, alert and
armed, brought up the rear, and long did
they wave their caps to their beloved comrades,
who stood on Aurelian's Wall to see
the last of them. Two days afterwards
Augustine came back alone. The cowardly
terror of his monks had so increased that they
sent their prior to entreat the holy Gregory
that they should not be compelled to undertake
so dangerous, toilsome, and uncertain a
journey. But the holy Gregory was inexorable.
He sent back Augustine, telling them
that "it was better not to begin a good work
than to think of desisting from that which
had been begun. It behoves you, my beloved
sons," he went on, "to fulfil the good work
which, by the help of our Lord, you have
undertaken, being assured that much labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
is followed by an eternal reward. When
Augustine returns, humbly obey him in all
things." So the cowardly missionaries had
to go on; but very few intended to trust their
precious skins beyond Arles, or some other
safe place for monks in the south of France.
Forthere was much amused at the return of
Augustine, believing that his stories had
played a part in frightening the monks, whom
he thoroughly despised.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the plans for the rescue were
put in train without delay. On the first day
Bassus and Porlor watched the approaches to
the Pamphronian villa. Coelred searched the
warehouses under the Aventine Hill, where
they had all been confined when they first
came to Rome. But the place was deserted.
Lilla and Forthere went through every street
and lane in the Suburra, scanning each face
that passed them, but without result. Next
day the rescuers were more fortunate. Forthere
was again prowling in the vilest purlieus
of the Suburra, when he caught sight of a face
he recognised. Its owner was muffled in a
cloak, which he drew quickly over his head,
and ran at speed down a narrow lane. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
another moment the hand of Forthere was
upon him. His struggles were unavailing,
and he was dragged out into the open space
at the foot of the Palatine, gagged, and bound.
Forthere was almost certain that the face was
that of one of the servants of Mystacon. The
sun had set, and as soon as it was dusk the
vigorous young Englishman half carried and
half dragged his captive across the Forum,
and down the Appian Way to the garden of
the villa of Symmachus. Forthere shared a
<i>cubiculum</i> in the villa with his cousins. In
this little room he deposited the living bundle,
and left him still more securely bound and
gagged. He required the rede of Porlor and
his other comrades before proceeding further.
He found Coelred and Bassus watching the
villa of Pamphronius, while Porlor and Lilla
returned from fruitless searches soon afterwards.
They all began to examine their
prisoner.</p>

<p>The man swore that he had never seen
his captors before, and had never heard of
Mystacon; but they all recognised him, so
he was turned on his back, a sword was put
on his throat, and he was told that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
be drawn across it if he told a single lie.
They then found that Sivel had been several
days at Rome, confined in a house in the
Suburra; not ill treated, the man declared,
but only kept secure. All this time Mystacon
had been bargaining for the full price of Sivel
to be paid again to him if he was restored,
pretending that he was not actually in Rome.
Pamphronius offered half the price. He was
furious at the way his slaves had been taken
from him, and would pay high for the mere
spiteful pleasure of getting them into his
power. A bargain had at length been struck,
and Sivel was to be delivered over to his
master the next day, after noon. The man
was tied up again, gagged, and secured in the
stable.</p>

<p>After a consultation, it was decided that the
intended preliminary interview between Lilla
and Pamphronius would be unnecessary.
They now knew all they wanted to know.
They would watch for the arrival of Mystacon
and his victim, and effect the rescue by force.
All the old fury that they had felt when they
first heard that they were to be sold as slaves
came back to them&mdash;the mortification and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
burning shame. Forthere was beside himself
with rage at the thoughts of the old insults
and of the danger to which his beloved little
brother was still exposed. It would be a bad
time for Mystacon when he next met the
outraged lads. In the morning they looked
carefully to their arms; and saw that the
horses were ready for a start at any moment,
with a small supply of food for each rider.</p>

<p>In the afternoon all five comrades concealed
themselves behind a ruined wall, and kept
careful watch over the villa of Pamphronius.
It was thought better to allow the slave&ndash;dealer
with his party to enter than to attack
him in the road, where they might be interrupted.
Forthere had a heavy club, the
rest were armed with swords. All had long
knives. After an anxious interval, they at
length heard many footsteps. First came
Mystacon himself, looking proud and self&ndash;satisfied,
and it was with the greatest difficulty
that Forthere could restrain himself from
flying at the villain's throat. Then followed
a closed litter, carried by slaves, and half a
dozen armed men. The doors of the villa
were closed, but when Mystacon knocked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
uttered the words "Servus Captus" in a loud
voice, they were thrown open. The little
procession passed in, and they were quickly
closed and barred again. The boys rushed
towards the doors, furious and baffled; but
Porlor made a sign for silence. He then
knocked in his turn and said "Servus Captus"
in a loud voice. Again the doors were thrown
open, and a tall slave appeared. Porlor flew
at his throat, and the unexpected assault threw
him off his balance. He fell without uttering
a sound, and in another instant Forthere had
cut his throat. They were now in the large
deserted <i>atrium</i>. At the other end there
were heavy curtains concealing the great hall,
and behind them they heard voices.</p>

<p>The five lads pulled themselves together.
They were well armed, but they were about
to face heavy odds if the attendants showed
fight. They drew their swords. "Ready?"
cried Coelred, and the curtains were torn aside.
Coelred and Forthere occupied the entrance,
while Lilla and Bassus rushed across the hall
to the opposite door, to prevent all escape.
Porlor then advanced a little and looked round.
On the right, at a table, were Pamphronius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and Mystacon. On the left was Sivel tied
hands and feet, and held by two slaves, with
half a dozen armed men behind them. To
send the slaves flying and cut the bonds was
the work of an instant. Porlor put his arm
round Sivel, who flew to his side. The other
four lads made a furious onslaught on the
armed men. Lilla ran the foremost through
the body, Bassus cut down another, and the
rest threw down their swords and surrendered.
"The first that moves is a dead man," cried
Coelred, and Forthere proceeded to secure
and gag them. Pamphronius and Mystacon
remained to be dealt with. The slave&ndash;dealer's
face was blanched with fear. Too well he
recognised his assailants. But the patrician
tried to put a bold face on the matter.
"The Holy Father will make you all answer
for this outrage," he cried. "Osvitus and
Sivellus are my property. I have a right to
recover them. They belong to me." This
was more than Forthere could stand. To
his astonishment Pamphronius found himself
seized by the throat and dragged into the
middle of the room. "Miserable wretch!"
shouted the enraged Englishman. "Lilla is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the descendant of God, Sivel is the brother
of a goddess. Their fathers were brave
warriors who could make a hundred such
creatures as you run before them. You are
not good enough to be their slave. Kneel
down and ask their pardon, or I will smash
your skull," and he raised the heavy club he
had brought with him. The patrician had
never been spoken to in this way in all his
life. But he was in mortal terror, and did
what he was told. "Shall I kill the niddring?"
asked Forthere. "It is not necessary," said
Porlor. So he was well tied up, gagged, and
rolled into a corner. Then Mystacon was
brought forward howling for mercy, and reminding
the boys of all his kindness. "For you,
vile wretch," said Coelred, "there can be no forgiveness.
You had fair warning. We prayed
to you to spare us from shame and humiliation,
and you had no mercy. We told you then that
we would kill you, and Englishmen always
keep faith. You must die, and at our hands."
He made a sign to Forthere, who ran Mystacon
through and through, and he fell dead. "We
could not have left Rome with honour," said
Coelred, "until this was done."</p><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">They all went quickly to the villa of
Symmachus, and prepared to mount their
horses. Coelred and Porlor had already
explained what was about to happen to their
kind old friend Otacilia, and taken their
leave. "Will you be able to ride, my Sivel?"
asked Forthere, as he tenderly embraced his
recovered brother. "Anywhere with you,"
replied the boy. He looked very pale and ill.
But there was no time to be lost. They
hastily mounted, and, led by Coelred, they
galloped down to the Asinarian Gate. The
guard turned out, and was attacked furiously
by the Englishmen. Two men were cut down,
and the rest ran away for help. Bassus and
Lilla dismounted to unbar and throw open the
gates, and they all galloped out into the starry
night. For several hours they rode on at a
steady pace, but they did not appear to have
been followed. So they stopped for a few
hours of rest before sunrise, tethered their
horses, and were soon fast asleep. Next day
they continued to ride northwards, stopping
at noon for a short siesta. All this time they
had been too eager while riding, and too tired
when resting, to consult much with each other;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and they were awakened from their noonday
sleep by a great band of armed and mounted
warriors who surrounded them. Roughly
seized, they were almost in despair when they
were dragged before the commander of this
force.</p>

<p>But all turned out well. In the handsome
warrior with huge drooping moustache
Coelred was reminded of the Gothic Prince
Athanagild. "He must be of our kindred,"
he thought, and spoke to him in English,
saying that he and his companions were
Englishmen, escaping from bondage at Rome,
who threw themselves on his protection. The
commander was well pleased, received the lads
as his countrymen, and enlisted them in his
force. It was quite providential that they
should have fallen in with these Saxons, for they
would be taken by them in safety within easy
reach of England. A large Saxon army of
nearly 20,000 men had entered the service of
Agilulphus, who ascended the throne of the
Lombards in 590. But they were not satisfied,
and were about to return in a body to their
own country on the lower Rhine. There was
nothing to stop them, and a few months after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
our English lads entered their ranks they
commenced their march over the Alps, and
down the course of the Rhine, a journey
presenting physical difficulties, and of great
interest, but involving no danger when in such
powerful company. This protection continued
until our young heroes found themselves on
the shores of the German Ocean, facing their
own native land. They had resolved to
return from the first. They were always
confident that the happy day would come.
Alca had told them that they were not to die
in a distant land. Now they were full of
joyful anticipations. Her words, as they
always knew, were true. The years of banishment
were past and gone for ever.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">THE STORY OF AUGUSTINE</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Six tall young warriors landed one summer
morning on the British shore, at Ebbs&ndash;fleet, in
the Isle of Thanet. They were healthy, and
strong, and goodly to look upon. The eldest
was a dark Italian, the others with the fair
hair and florid complexions of Englishmen.
Young Sivel had quite recovered his health
and good looks, and all were alert and ready
for anything that might betide. It was the
last year of the sixth century. Their eager
inquiries were answered by the news that
some Italian monks and two English lads had
landed two years before, and had been allowed
to establish themselves at Canterbury, the
capital of the kingdom of Kent.</p>

<p>The Jutes who formed the Kentish settlement
had been near neighbours of the English
on the Continent, and like the royal houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of Bernicia and Deira, the Æskingas of Kent
were descended from Woden. King Ethelbert
had succeeded his father Imeric in 561, and
was now an old man, having reigned for thirty&ndash;eight
years. He had married a Frankish
princess, Bertha, the daughter of Charibert,
King of Paris. They were an aged couple,
and their son Eadbald had arrived at man's
estate. Ethelbert, in spite of one crushing
defeat which he received at Wimbledon from
Ceaulin and Cutha of Wessex in 568, had
been a successful ruler. Northwards his
influence extended to the Humber. Sledda,
the King of Essex, who married his sister
Ricula, acknowledged his sovereignty, and he
was received by all the English people south
of the Humber as Bretwalda, or overlord.
As the Queen Bertha was a Christian, she
had always had a priest in attendance upon
her, and Luidhard, the Bishop of Senlis, was
now her chaplain.</p>

<p>The young warriors became acquainted
with these particulars on their arrival, and, as
horses could not be procured at once, they
set out on foot for Canterbury. The first
person they met, superintending some buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
outside the town, was their old friend
Peter. He told them that Hereric and
Godric were safe and well, and conducted
them to the temporary monastery, where the
Atheling and his young companion were soon
embracing their friends. At length all the
boys were again united. Soon they sat down
round Hereric, to hear the story of his
adventures.</p>

<p>"I and Godric," he said, "saw you all
waving to us from the wall of Aurelian as we
rode out of Rome, looking so tall and strong,
and we were happy in the certainty that, if it
was God's will, you would rescue our Sivel.
It was a mournful journey, for the unwilling
monks did nothing but sigh and groan
with coward fear, for which our Forthere was
partly answerable. The stories they told, on
his authority, were enough to appal even
brave men, which they certainly were not.
At last they sent back the Prior to entreat
the Holy Father to allow them to return to
Rome. But Gregory's reply urged them to
proceed, and the threats of Augustine obliged
them to continue the journey. When we
arrived at Arles, the good bishop Vergilius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
received us most hospitably, and supplied us
with the means of carrying ourselves and our
goods across France. Here many of the monks
feigned sickness, and declared that they could
not travel. They were left behind, and others
fell away when we passed through towns where
there were convents with the Benedictine rule.
Queen Brunehaud of Austrasia sent us a Frankish
interpreter, but although I could understand
him, he had no knowledge of English,
and was useless in the interpretation of Augustine's
Latin. We went over much of the
road we all know so well, and at Amfleet our
pitiful condition, when we stood shivering on
the sand, came back to our minds.</p>

<p>"Forty very cowardly monks and servants
left Rome. Only a fourth part embarked at
Amfleet. The party consisted of the Prior
Augustine, Laurentius and Peter, Godric and
I, and five convent servants. We landed in
the island of Thanet, which, as you saw, is
separated from Kent by the river Wantsum,
nearly a mile in width. All now depended
upon us, for the monks could not speak a
word to the people, and the Frank sent by
Queen Brunehaud was of little or no use. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
proposed to Augustine that I should go to the
King of the country, announce his arrival, and
ask for license to land. The Prior consented,
but enjoined me to conceal my rank and
name. I rode to Canterbury, and was allowed
to have an interview with King Ethelbert and
his son Eadbald. The Queen was also present,
and the Bishop of Senlis. They received me
very kindly, and allowed me to keep my name
and rank from them until a time when I could
more fitly divulge it. Eadbald did not wish
that the monks should be allowed to remain.
But the Queen and her bishop strongly urged
their cause, and I was sent back with a message
that they might remain until Ethelbert
had seen them, when they would hear further.</p>

<p>"I returned to Thanet, and, by order of the
King, we were supplied with provisions and a
house. Here were stored the precious Eastern
bales of Coelred and Porlor, five books sent
by Gregory, a cross and a picture, and some
vestments. A few days afterwards the King
came to Thanet, and, sitting in the open air,
he ordered our company to be brought before
him. He would not let us come into his
presence under a roof, lest we should practise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
any magical arts so as to impose upon him,
and get the better of him. The Prior formed
the most imposing procession possible under
the circumstances. First he came himself
bearing a silver cross in his hand, with Laurentius
and Peter close behind him, carrying
a board with the Son of God painted upon it.
Next came Godric and I, while the five convent
servants brought up the rear, singing a
litany. The King ordered Augustine to deliver
his message, and when I explained the
royal words, the Prior began to preach in
Latin until they all seemed weary, for not a
word did they understand. He then told me
to repeat what he had said in English more
briefly, which I did, giving only the substance
of his discourse. The King and those with
him seemed very favourably impressed; and
not only was permission granted for the monks
to live in Canterbury, but a promise was given
to supply them with all necessaries, and they
had license to preach the new religion."</p>

<p>"All this was due to Hereric alone," interrupted
Godric. "The Prior was so long
and unintelligible that they were all weary of
him, and I am sure that he and his monks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
would have been sent straight back to France.
But when the Atheling stood up, not stooping
with a cowl over his head, but erect and graceful,
with his golden hair waving in the breeze,
the scene changed as if by magic. All eyes
were turned to him, and every man present
listened eagerly. His voice, as we all know,
is sweet and pleasant to hear. He described
the wonderful birth and the good works of
Jesus. He related the events of His death
with such feeling that the Kentish warriors
swore great oaths, while Ethelbert sprang to
his feet, drew his sword, and waved it over
his head with excitement. The monks were
terrified. The servants ran away, Augustine
and Laurentius cowered down, old Peter alone
stood his ground. They understood nothing,
but heard the oaths and saw the old King
with his drawn sword, vowing vengeance on
the Jews. There was a long pause. Then,
in a gentler voice, Hereric declared to them
that the Son of God had risen from the dead
to save all, of every nation under heaven, who
turned to Him for comfort and help in the
hour of death. When he stopped there was
not one present, from the King downwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
who was not willing to grant anything the
Atheling might ask."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Hereric, "our Godric goes too
far. I was but the instrument to convey
Augustine's meaning in English words." "It
was not the words," persisted Godric; "it was
the gracious person that delivered the discourse,
and the way he spoke the words, that
won all hearts. Say, my brothers, who was
it that deserves the praise?" "Hereric!
Hereric!" they all shouted, Forthere more
vociferously than the rest. "It is the partial
voice of love," resumed Hereric, "which methinks
is a little beyond reason. Say no more
of me, I pray." "We must speak out," said
Forthere, "for the jealous monks will not
put thy name into their chronicle, it will be
Augustine who did it all." Hereric looked
distressed, and the subject was dropped.
"We all marched to Canterbury," he continued,
"and as we drew near the city, with
the cross raised on high, Augustine caused
another litany to be sung. We were temporarily
lodged in a house, where the Prior at
once established and put in force the <i>Regula
Monachorum</i> of St. Benedict, in use at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Andrew's on the Caelian Hill. As the monks
were unable to preach intelligibly, they had
to be contented with good works for a time."
"Yes," said the incorrigible Godric, "they
have resorted to signs and wonders and miraculous
cures. Augustine performed more
miracles in the short time he was at Canterbury
than he ever dared to attempt during
his former life, under the eye of Gregory at
Rome. I can work some of them myself."
"So can I," added Forthere, "and I know
very well how others are done." The Atheling
took no notice of this interruption.
"There is," he went on, "on the east side of
this city a church built by the Romans, and
dedicated to St. Martin, of whom we all
heard at the Gate of the Twins outside
Amiens, when we were in the power of
Mystacon. Here the Frankish Bishop performs
Christian services for the Queen. Here
the monks say masses and baptize, and Ethelbert
himself has submitted to the rite of
baptism. But the people hold back, encouraged
by Eadbald. Augustine himself is
not here. He has hurried back to France to
be consecrated by the Bishop of Arles; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
before he went he had obtained from the King
the grant of another old Roman church, which
he has dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul,
and where he has begun to build a monastery.
It was there that you met old Peter, who is
to be the first Abbot. I have promised to
remain here until Augustine returns as Bishop,
and until I have taught Laurentius and Peter
enough English to enable them to preach to
the people. Godric has promised to stay with
me, and I know Forthere will also. You
all need rest. Besides, our absence has been
long, and we have heard no news. I have
indeed received a rumour that Ella, our King,
is dead, and that our country has been seized
by the Bernicians. I fear that it will be a
sad home&ndash;coming for most of us. Let us
give ourselves a little time for preparation
to bear our sorrows manfully. I would fain
desire that we should all come home together."
They unanimously agreed to wait
for Hereric, and to go home in his company.
It was a great joy to be together
again, not only with no one missing, but with
one more, the faithful Bassus, added to their
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"At one time," said Godric, "I feared that
our Atheling would become a monk, but now
I know that he never will." "Wherefore?"
asked the rest. "Because he is in love,"
replied Godric. Hereric blushed crimson
when Godric went on to declare that the
name of Braga was often on his lips when
he slept. "Truly," said Porlor, "the Prince
used to be very fond of our little sister. If
he ever had a present to give, it was always
for Braga. Do you remember, Coelred, the
day when Alca came to visit us at Stillingfleet?
That very day Hereric presented little
Braga with a pretty scarf. I think it was
the last gift she received from any of us."
"Hereric is not the only one," said Forthere,
wishing to turn attention from the Atheling.
"Lilla is also in love, if words spoken
in sleep are to be so explained. Twice have
I heard him whispering the name of Bergliot."
"'Tis true," said Coelred, "that the young
Princess's last message was for our Oswith,
when she left us on that fatal day." So the
light talk went on, full of joyous reminiscences
of home and friends; until Hereric said that
they must all speak reverently of their loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
ones, if they spoke at all, until they knew
certainly what had befallen.</p>

<p>During the days that they were waiting for
Augustine, the companions helped Peter in his
work at the monastery, and Hereric was a good
deal employed in teaching English to the
monks. In the long summer evenings they
engaged in conversations. The most important
took place a few days before they all set out
for home, and was chiefly conducted by Porlor.
He dwelt upon their peculiar position among
their countrymen, and suggested rules of conduct.
"We are like men apart," he said. "I
have felt already in my intercourse with the
Æskingas that there is a sort of gulf between
us. Our knowledge is immeasurably greater
than that of our people. This is not due to
any merit of our own, but simply to what has
happened. But it is a fact. We are as if we
had been born in some later age."</p>

<p>"I do not think that Godric and I know
very much more than our countrymen," said
Forthere. "It is true," replied Porlor, "that
there are differences amongst us. Hereric is
as learned as any monk. Sivel understands
the laws and the arts of the Greeks. Both can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
read and write. Lilla and Bassus have acquired
a practical knowledge of Roman strategy.
Coelred and I have learnt much in our wanderings.
Nor can Forthere and Godric be left
out. They too have stored up knowledge in
their travels and at Rome. No, Forthere;
you and Godric are included in all that I shall
say. What I feel is that our knowledge is a
gift from above, but a gift that we must not
use for ourselves only. It is a trust that we
are to use for our people, and we must think
how it can best be used. My fear is that if
we openly proclaim our greater knowledge, if
we suddenly begin to tell of what we know and
to advise, if we assume that we are wiser than
our people, we shall be distrusted, by many
disbelieved, and our power for good will pass
away. Remember Coifi. All men confess
that he is more learned than any one else in
Deira, yet who would listen to him in counsel
or take his advice? He talks too much, and is
without credit or influence."</p>

<p>The others thought a great deal over what
Porlor had said. On the next evening Lilla
continued the discussion. "We have," he
began, "been gifted with rare knowledge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
experience, such as our fellow&ndash;countrymen can
never possess except through equally extraordinary
accidents. Our gifts are, as Porlor
says, a trust to be used with great care for
our country. I have thought long over the
matter, and I believe with him that we shall
lose the power we may surely gain unless we
act wisely. What think you, my Coelred?"
"My rede is," said Coelred, "that, accepting the
counsel and the warning of Porlor, we should
keep silence until such time as the knowledge
that any of us possesses above that of our
countrymen would be useful to them. Then
we should use it, but even then by action
rather than by speech. Such conduct will be
very hard to adopt, and we shall need much
counsel amongst ourselves." Hereric added
that he agreed with all that had been said,
except that the Princess Alca and their other
loved ones must be told all they knew, withholding
nothing. In this all concurred. Sivel
asked Porlor to propose rules of conduct which
might serve as laws for them in this grave
matter.</p>

<p>Next day Porlor said, "I have been thinking
carefully over a scheme for us to adopt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
We are dear friends, tried by companionship
in danger, in sorrow, in shame, in hardships,
and we know and are certain that our friendship
can have no change for ever. We must
make a compact to watch over our gifts for the
good of our countrymen. We must often take
counsel with each other how to maintain our
credit and influence, and how to use our gifts
prudently and wisely. We will be one body,
devoted to the weal of our countrymen, but in
a sense apart. We will form a <i>Gemót</i> of close
friends and brothers for ever." The rede of
Porlor was the judgment of all. They clasped
hands upon it, and the Coelred&ndash;<i>Gemót</i> was
formed.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Augustine returned in all
the importance of his episcopal dignity. His
head was busy about the things pertaining to
his office. Although as yet he scarcely had a
flock, he promptly sent a long series of puzzling
questions to Gregory about the degrees of
kindred within which members of his flock
might marry, and on other abstruse points.
He also began to work miracles again, and
to quarrel with the Welsh bishops about the
calculation of the date of Easter. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
conceal his satisfaction that Hereric was about
to leave him, which surprised the simple&ndash;minded
Atheling, but which did not surprise
Godric or Forthere. Hereric explained to the
King of Kent that he was a Prince of the
house of Deira, and Ethelbert ordered an
escort to see him and his friends as far as the
Humber. A message was also sent to London,
to secure hospitality for them from Sledda,
the King of Essex. Ethelbert wished them a
cordial farewell. They also had a friendly
parting from their old teachers, Laurentius and
Peter, who gave their blessings.</p>

<p>They first rode to London, then sparsely
inhabited, and saw the old Roman walls, the
ruins of the temple of Diana on the hill, and
the <i>miliarium</i> whence all the main roads
diverged. Sledda and his wife Ricula received
them well in the ruined old prætorium near
the temple, and sent them on their way with
a fresh relay of horses. In two days they came
to the country of the Gainas, and reached
Godric's home near the banks of the Idle. To
the boy's great joy he found his old father
Ulchel still alive, but failing, and their meeting
was most pathetic. The friends were received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
very hospitably, and Bassus, who was ill,
remained behind with Godric until they should
be sent for by Coelred. The rest pressed
northwards, with pack&ndash;horses bearing the
precious bales. They intended to proceed in
a body to Bilbrough, and hear all the news,
bad and good, from their kind old friend
Saebald the Fairfax, before they ventured to
seek their homes. Going rapidly along the
old Roman road, they came in sight of the
well&ndash;known Ingrish Hill with feelings of deep
anxiety.</p>

<div class="break">

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">HOME AGAIN</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Saebald, chief of the Billingas, had just returned
from visiting his outposts on the
Wharfe. He was standing at the gate of his
burg when he beheld six horsemen and some
pack animals advancing towards him up the
hill. As they came nearer he saw that the
men were fully armed and accoutred, but he
could not guess who they could be. They
rode up, dismounted, and stood before him.
He looked from one to the other with doubt
and astonishment, until his eyes rested upon
Sivel, whom he recognised at once. In a
moment they were in each other's arms, and
Sivel spoke the names of his companions. It
was long before Saebald could recognise his
little friends in these stalwart young warriors.
His surprise was extreme, but his welcome was
hearty and cordial. He showed unfeigned joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
at their marvellous reappearance. "Knowing
your friendship," said Coelred, "we came here
first to hear from you all that has happened in
our absence, for we know nothing. We did
not dare to go to our homes, fearing to find
empty hearths." He then very briefly told the
story of the kidnapping, said that they had
had many strange adventures, but that they
had sworn to each other to come home together,
and that at length they had succeeded. "Our
stories will keep," he added, "but our anxiety
is so great that we cannot wait longer for your
news." Saebald insisted upon their having
supper first, and then they went out and sat
round the Billinga chief on the hillside.</p>

<p>"You have given me a melancholy task,"
said the Fairfax, "for I shall cause grief and
pain to each one of my young friends. No
anxiety was felt until you had been missing
for two days. Then search was made in every
direction, and vigilant watch was kept on the
rivers. The Princess Bergliot was overwhelmed
with grief, and told some story about the curse
of a nixy, but neither she nor the dog could
guide the search farther than to the mouth of
Stillingfleet beck. Guthlaf stopped every boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
that passed up and down the river, hanging all
the crews whose answers did not satisfy him.
By this means many sea&ndash;thieves were disposed
of." "But not our sea&ndash;thieves," said Porlor,
"for they were all hanged by the Franks when
we were landed." "At last," continued Saebald,
"anxiety gave way to despair. There was
mourning in many homes, for no boys were
ever so beloved. My poor Forthere, your loss
must be told first. Verbeia, your gentle
mother, never held up her head again. She
died of grief within a month." Forthere and
Sivel bowed their heads to hide their tears.
The eyes of the rest were full, for too surely
they felt that worse was coming.</p>

<p>"Towards the end of the year," Saebald
went on, "a great calamity befell Deira. Our
King died very suddenly with suspicion of
poison. Some looked askance at Coifi; for
the dirge he chanted at Aldby when King
Ella returned victorious from the borders of
Elmet was remembered against him. Things
looked even more suspicious when it was
known that Coifi had taken refuge with King
Ethelric of Bernicia. Ella was scarcely in his
grave before news arrived that the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Bernicia was advancing upon York with a
large army, led by his two fierce sons,
Ethelfrith and Theobald. Elfric, the unconquered
Atheling, hastily assembled a force to
oppose them. The gathering was at York.
I came first with the Billingas. Seomel,
Guthlaf, and Brand, with their men, were close
on my heels. But there was no time to wait
for more. The Heslingas were to guard the
Princess and little Edwin, the hope of Deira,
at Aldby. Elfric then advanced to encounter
heavy odds. Battle was joined beyond the
forest. We were overpowered by numbers.
First the noble Guthlaf fell, like a stag at bay
surrounded by the dogs. Seomel was slain
while valorously warding off blows from the
Atheling. Finally, Elfric himself, after dealing
death around him, bowed his proud head
and breathed his last. Brand and I were
fighting near, and when we saw that all was
lost, we drew off our men. 'Edwin must
be taken out of the land or he will be
murdered. The sons of Ida are merciless.'
These were Brand's words as we galloped
towards York. The old warrior said he would
go to Aldby and secure the child, if possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
inducing the Princess to come with him, while
I placed relays of fresh horses outside York
and at Tadcaster.</p>

<p>"Old Brand, as I have been told, broke
the fatal news to the Princess, and urged
upon her that there was no time to lose, and
that she and Edwin must escape out of the
country. She replied that her duty was to
remain; but that she would entrust the child
to her father's oldest and most faithful friend.
There was no time to be lost. It was known
that the Bernician army was marching rapidly
on York. The Princess Alca folded the child
in a tender embrace, and put it into the
arms of Brand. 'Most valorous warrior,' she
said, 'I entrust to your care the hope of
Deira.' Her own resolution was immutable.
Brand knelt and kissed the hand of the elf&ndash;maiden,
then mounted his horse and galloped
away. I waited with fresh horses on the
Mount at York, and rode with them to
Nehalennia's ford. There I bade farewell to
old Brand, my beloved uncle, and swore
obedience to young King Edwin, returning
disconsolately to Bilbrough.</p>

<p>"Brave old Ingeld, with the Heslingas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
remained as a guard at Aldby. But they
were not molested. Ethelric advanced to
York, and, as resistance was unavailing, the
country submitted. We had no Atheling
to lead us. Hereric was lost, his brother
Osric was a child. The Bernician King was
an old man. He appointed Coifi Priest of
Woden, with charge of all the sacred images
at Godmundham. Four years afterwards he
died, and was succeeded by his son Ethelfrith
the Wild&mdash;a fierce, dangerous man, hating all
opposition, and often false to his plighted
word. He had twice asked for Alca in
marriage, but had been repulsed.</p>

<p>"The Princess continued to live at Aldby,
with the children of Elfric, Osric and Bergliot,
the Lady Volisia, and her young daughters
Braga and Nanna. Worn out with grief and
anxiety, Volisia died a year after the coming
of the Bernicians. Month after month, year
after year, passed away, and nothing more was
heard of Brand and little Edwin. One day
an aged British priest, named Urien, arrived
at Aldby and asked for an interview with the
Princess. He came owing to a solemn promise
he had made to Brand when he died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Gwynedd. Urien brought up the boy after
Brand's death, but one day Edwin said
that he would leave Gwynedd, and go to a
country where Englishmen dwelt. The boy
departed, and Urien had heard nothing more
of him. So the old man kept his vow, undertook
the long journey to tell Alca, and then
returned. The Princess remained quite confident
that Edwin was safe, and all knew that
she must be right.</p>

<p>"The last event I have to relate is the
strangest of all. About a year ago King
Ethelfrith again asked for Alca in marriage,
and she consented on conditions. She sent
for us, the surviving thegns of Deira, and
said that she only lived for her country, and
that she would consent to be Queen of Bernicia
on condition that Ethelfrith would solemnly
declare that Edwin was King of Deira, and
that he only ruled until the child was old
enough to assume the government. 'The
King has consented,' continued the Princess,
'and is here,' Ethelfrith came into the great
hall and made the declaration in our presence.
He looked haggard and fierce, but cowed.
Then Alca became his Queen. She has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
beautiful child named Oswald. Ethelfrith is
devoted to Alca, but we all think that his
devotion is more like terror than love. A
glance from her stills his rage, and he almost
cowers in her presence. Fierce, cruel, and suspicious
when he is away from the Queen, her
presence at once calms and softens him. All
who are under her protection are safe. It is
evident that he dare not molest them. It
may be her goodness and purity which effect
this change, but she must also possess some
power which is incomprehensible to us. Thus
we his enemies, the thegns of Deira, are not
molested, though we must obey the King's
summons to war. And now, my boys, my
sad story is told. I see that you are overwhelmed
with grief, and it is best that you
should all seek rest."</p>

<p>The lads got little sleep that night. The
wounds were too fresh, the grief too acute
during the first hours. They wept long and
silently over their lost ones and the desolated
hearths. In the morning they besought
Saebald to make their plans for them. He
said that he would go with Forthere and
Sivel to Ulfskelf. The other four should cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the Ouse at Acaster, whence Lilla would visit
his home at Hemingborough. "You must go
to your homes at once," he said, "and assume
your positions among your people. On the
first of the next moon you shall all meet
again at Stillingfleet, and thence fare onward
to Bambrough, where the Queen now is. I
will send a messenger in advance with the
wonderful news of your arrival, to prepare
her mind. The little girls, too, must not be
taken quite by surprise. A great war with
the Scots is threatened, so you must promptly
offer your swords to King Ethelfrith."</p>

<p>It was so arranged. Hereric, Coelred,
Porlor, and Lilla (Oswith) rode over to
Stillingfleet, where Tanwin, the old and
faithful servant of Seomel, had kept things
in order and led the Stillingas since his
master's death. He was overjoyed at the
sight of them, and it was long before he
could believe his eyes. Hereric and Coelred,
he declared, were Elfric and Seomel over
again, as he remembered them when they
first bore arms. They went slowly up the
hill to the deserted hall, their hearts too full
for words. An aged dog was lying on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
heap of ferns in the yard. "Shuprak,"
they cried, and the faithful old dog raised
itself on its forelegs, gave a joyful bark, and
fell forward. The lads burst into tears. It
was the last straw. When they ran up,
Shuprak was dead. Tanwin said that it had
lain for months without moving, and taking
little food. They made its grave on the other
side of the beck, near the place where it generally
ran into the forest. As they covered its
remains with earth, slowly and reverently,
Porlor said, "Suparaka is Yama. We will
not be less worthy than Yudisthira." The
lads understood each other.</p>

<p>Next day the Stillingas assembled and
swore that Coelred and Porlor were their
leaders. Each ceorl walked past his chiefs
and touched their weapons in token of fealty&mdash;the
ceremony of the wapentake. Sad as it
all was, it was necessary to give a great feast
in the old hall. Lilla wished his friends to
accompany him to Hemingborough, where the
same scenes were repeated. The Hemingas
crowded round the son of Guthlaf, and swore
that Oswith (they did not yet know him by
the name of Lilla) was their leader, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
performing the wapentake ceremony. They
might well be proud of the splendid young
warrior as he went round to each man,
renewing the acquaintance of his boyhood.
Again and again, both at Stillingfleet and
Hemingborough, the tale of their disappearance,
of the long&ndash;continued but fruitless
search, of the despair of their parents, was
repeated to the friends, with many details
passed over by Saebald. They heard about
the great battle in which their fathers fell,
and were told of the numerous losses on
the field, and of the sullen submission of
the survivors, while curses were heaped on
the head of Ethelfrith the Wild. Their homes
seemed desolate without the loved faces
of their dear ones and the welcome bark
of old Shuprak. It was indeed a sad homecoming.</p>

<p>They were glad when, at the appointed
time, Forthere and Sivel arrived from Ulfskelf,
where they too had passed a mournful time.
The gentle mother of Forthere had been
killed by extremity of grief. Old Brand had
died far away from home and kindred. The
hearthstone was quite cold at Ulfskelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The six lost ones, found again, set out
together from Stillingfleet and rode northwards
into Bernicia. Pack&ndash;horses, with their
precious bales, were in charge of old Tanwin
and his son Froda, and of Ingebrand,
the faithful servant of Elfric, who had now
attached himself to Hereric. In three days
they reached Bambrough, the capital of Bernicia.
It was an almost impregnable place.
The fortress rises up from a solitary rock
of black basalt overlooking the sea. The
building of Ethelfrith's time was constructed
by his grandfather Ida in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 550, on the
site of a fort built by order of Agricola, and
was named Bebbanburgh after his wife Bebba.
The interior court was extensive, with a great
hall of timber, and many rooms opening into
the hall or directly upon the court. The
whole had been surrounded by a quickset
hedge at first, for which a stone wall was
afterwards substituted.</p>

<p>Orders had been given for the suitable
reception of the guests, and they were soon
ushered into the presence of the Queen. Alca
was more stately and more beautiful than
when they parted from her at Aldby. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
cheering words had sunk into their hearts,
and had inspired their actions, keeping alive
hope when their need was greatest. Coelred
and Porlor regarded her with such devoted
love that no one else ever found a place in
their hearts. The adoration of the others was
little less profound. She embraced them all
as dear brothers returned after a long absence,
but with no surprise. "I knew you would
return," she said, "and I know by your looks
that you have returned unscathed by sin or
shame. You have returned, strong and bold
and full of knowledge, to serve your country
in its sore need. May the All&ndash;father bless
and preserve you!"</p>

<p>Then the girls and little Osric ran in, and
after the first warm greetings, Bergliot burst
into tears at the thought of the last parting
with her boys. The nixy's curse had always
been ringing in her ears. It would cease now.
She put her small hand shyly into her dear
Oswith's large one, while Braga nestled close
to Hereric, and Nanna tried to divide herself
between her brothers Coelred and Porlor.
The rest of the day was passed very happily,
and on the morrow the young warriors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
were to be presented to Ethelfrith at a great
audience.</p>

<p>Ethelfrith sat in the hall, surrounded by his
thegns. He scowled savagely as the young
men came in and stated their names and
positions, offering him their swords. But
when Alca entered and looked at him with a
calm searching glance, his mien changed and
he welcomed them warmly enough, accepting
their services with thanks. Next day Coelred
sent for Bassus and Godric, who arrived at
Bambrough soon afterwards.</p>

<p>In the following days the young men, one
after the other, related all they had seen and
heard to Alca in the minutest detail. They
told her of their conversations at Canterbury,
of their perplexities, of their proposed
<i>Gemót</i>; and they besought her guidance
and advice. The precious bales were opened
before her and offered for her acceptance.
There were gold ornaments of eastern workmanship,
precious stones, spices, myrrh and
frankincense, the small parcel of bdellium
presented by the Guru, boxes of sandal&ndash;wood,
fine calico and muslin, besides many bags of
gold coin. She insisted upon Coelred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Porlor retaining the money, and they afterwards
dug a hole by the side of Shuprak's
grave, which became the "<i>uvaru</i>" for their
treasures. Alca kept the bdellium and a
few things to please her young friends, and
distributed the rest among the delighted
girls. Alca had had described to her the whole
realm of France; the buildings and people of
Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria,
and Ujjayani; the navigation of the Eastern
Mediterranean, the Red and Erythraean Seas,
and the German Ocean; the habits and
customs of many peoples; the religion of
Christ, with Porlor's version of some heresies;
and the religions of the Fire&ndash;worshippers and
the Hindus; besides innumerable anecdotes
and stories. In the minds of most people such
an enormous mass of fresh and surprising
information could not have been assimilated.
It would simply have caused utter confusion.
But it was not so with Alca. She told the
boys that she would take a long time to think
over all they had told her, and arrange everything
clearly in her mind. When she had
done so, she promised to take them into her
counsels, to consult with them, and to let
them know her thoughts. But first they
must all fight bravely in the coming struggle
in which their country would be engaged.</p><br />

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Ædan, the King of the Scots, was assembling
an immense army with the object of invading
Northumbria and destroying Ethelfrith, his
forces, and his kingdom. Ethelfrith's followers
were very numerous, and both he and his
brother Theobald were valiant soldiers. But
they were ignorant of the art of war, head&ndash;strong,
and without judgment. Alca consulted
privately with her young friends. It
was ascertained that Ædan would advance up
the valley of the Eden, intending thence to
pour his forces down the western valleys and
converge on York. To defeat this plan Lilla
and Bassus conceived the brilliant idea of
imitating the strategy of Narses in the Median
Mountains. Ethelfrith was to advance down
the valley of the Eden with the main body of
his army, while his brother Theobald occupied
the mountains and threatened the enemy's
flank, but with strict orders to avoid an
engagement. Lilla and Bassus were to
remain with the King and direct the campaign.
Coelred and Porlor were to be at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the troops gathered from between Ouse and
Derwent. Saebald, Forthere, and Sivel were
to head all the levies from the west of the
Ouse. Hereric and Godric were to fight in
company with the thegns and their followers
from the east of Derwent. Thus all the
Deirans would be with the King, as well as
part of the Bernician army. The detached
force of Theobald would consist wholly of
Bernicians.</p>

<p>"But how are we to induce King Ethelfrith
to adopt all these measures?" said Bassus.
"Leave that to me," replied the Queen.
"You and Lilla, as you have named our
Oswith, are experienced men of the world.
You now have to practise that forbearance for
the cultivation of which you have resolved to
take counsel with each other. Take care
that Ethelfrith gives all the orders, and so
manage as that he will think that they all
originated from himself. Let him have the
glory, and it will be well. It is sufficient for
you to serve your country as brave and
faithful warriors."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards there was a great assembly
of chiefs in the hall of Bambrough to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the final instructions of the King. To the
astonishment of Lilla and Bassus, they heard
Ethelfrith make the following speech:&mdash;"I
have conceived the plan of marching down
the valley of the Eden to meet the enemy in
front, while my brother with a picked force of
Bernicians will threaten their flank from the
mountains. But it is my strict and positive
order to Theobald to avoid an engagement.
Lilla and Bassus are to remain near my person.
The whole Deiran force will form part of my
division, and I shall have my eye on their
chiefs, especially on the young men who lately
offered me their swords. My plan is perfect,
and victory is certain if our men do their duty.
Prepare to march in a few days."</p>

<p>Ethelfrith believed that all the arrangements
were originated by himself when the army set
out from Bambrough in two divisions, to fight
one of the most decisive battles in the dawn
of our history.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">DEATH OF ALCA</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">It was in the autumn of the year 603 that
the battle was fought which finally settled the
question of supremacy between Scots and
English. Sivel had already introduced the
system of counting time <i>Anno Domini</i> among
the associates of the Coelred&ndash;<i>Gemót</i>, which
was a valuable help to them, both in discussing
the past and forecasting the future. This
year was a great epoch in their lives. Lilla
and Bassus were comparatively veterans. All
the rest were about to fight in their first
battle.</p>

<p>Ethelfrith's army was in the upper part of
the Eden valley. It was known that a mighty
host was being led by Ædan and by Hering
the son of Hussa up the course of the river.
Bassus had arranged with his friends that
strong parties of scouts should be thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
out to watch the movements of the enemy.
They were led by Forthere, Godric, and Sivel.
After a few days Forthere came back with
the news that a large body of the enemy,
apparently nearly half their army, had been
detached, and was marching up the hills to
the west. "Our plan works," said Bassus to
Lilla, "just as the plan of Narses worked, our
great master in the art of war." "But," said
Lilla, "the King's brother is not another
John the Prefect. The reckless Theobald will
never avoid an action." An hour afterwards
Ethelfrith sent a message to his brother with
reiterated commands to retreat before the
advancing foe. Then the English host, by
rapid marches, hurried down the valley and
attacked the weakened army of Ædan with
overwhelming force. The result was never
doubtful. The Scots were nearly exterminated,
and Ædan fled almost alone from the
field. After two days to rest and recruit their
strength, the English warriors were fresh and
ready to complete their work. Then a messenger
arrived with the news that Theobald
had refused to obey his brother's orders. He
would retreat before no man, he declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
He attacked the superior force of the enemy
when weather and ground and everything was
against him. He gave himself no chance.
There was a desperate fight, followed by the
death of Theobald and a prodigious slaughter
of the Bernicians. But the Scots were reported
to be much weakened and worn out
with long marches.</p>

<p>"Now for the final blow," said Bassus.
The scouts, under the direction of Forthere,
kept him well informed of the movements of
the enemy and the nature of the ground.
The Scots were marching so as to expose their
flank. At the right moment the English
army was set in motion and came upon the
enemy at a place which was long famous,
called Degsastan. The remnant of the army
of the Scots was here literally annihilated.</p>

<p>The news of this great victory spread over
the island. It was thought that no leader so
skilful and prudent, so wise and valorous, had
ever been known in England as Ethelfrith the
Wild. The fame of his generalship continued
long. A hundred years afterwards the Venerable
Bede declared that Ethelfrith "ravaged
the Britons more than all the great men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the English, insomuch that he might be compared
to Saul. To him might justly be applied
the saying of the Patriarch, 'Benjamin shall
ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
the prey, and at night he shall divide
the spoil.' He was a most worthy king, and
ambitious of glory." Lilla and Bassus, the
real generals, had far more precious fame in
the praise of the Queen, and the full and
ample reward of all the friends was in the
approval and smiles of Alca. Bede says that
"from that time no King of the Scots dared
to come into Britain to make war on the
English to this day."</p>

<p>For the next few years all the leaders in
the service of Ethelfrith had much harassing
work in repelling incursions from the direction
of Strathclyde, and it became known that the
King of Gwynedd was assembling a great
army to stake his fortune where the Scots
had failed. His standard was raised at
Chester. Bassus was deeply impressed with
the maxim that knowledge was power. He
acquired a minute personal acquaintance with
the routes across the moors to Chester. Forthere
again commanded the bands of scouts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and kept Lilla and Bassus well informed of
the numbers and movements of the enemy.
There was no difficulty in marching through
Elmet, as old Certicus was neutral, indeed
he had only too good an understanding with
Ethelfrith. The English army was assembled
at York. The Deiran chiefs were at the head
of their people, who were more numerous
than the Bernicians, the latter having suffered
severely in the war with the Scots.</p>

<p>Lilla and Bassus explained their plans to the
Queen, and a few days afterwards Ethelfrith
announced them in council as his own. That
wild King was managed with consummate tact.
The march was made direct over the moors to
Chester. The men of Gwynedd were found
drawn up outside the old Roman camp of the
20th Legion. It was their colony of Deva.
As battle was about to be joined, Ethelfrith
observed a crowd of priests, who had come
from the adjacent monastery of Bangor&ndash;Iscoed
to offer up prayers for the soldiers, standing
apart in a place of more safety. The King
asked who they were, and Forthere told him
that they were monks praying for his defeat,
and that there was a guard to protect them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
commanded by a British chief named Brochvael.
"If, then," said Ethelfrith, "they cry to their
God against us, though they do not bear
arms, yet they fight against us because they
oppose us by their prayers." He ordered
them to be attacked first, and then the chiefs
of Deira charged the host of Gwynedd, and,
after a long and desperate fight, the English
gained a complete victory. About two hundred
priests were slaughtered, and only fifty escaped,
their defender Brochvael having decamped at
the first appearance of danger. Their great
monastery of Bangor&ndash;Iscoed was destroyed.
The holy monks of Canterbury taught that
the massacre of British priests at Chester was
a sign of Divine vengeance on them for presuming
to differ in opinion from Augustine
on the subject of the time of keeping Easter.
That charitable prelate, who died in 604, had
already cursed them on the same account.</p>

<p>The victory of Chester was gained in
607, and from that time there was peace in
Northumbria for many years. The Deiran
thegns returned to their homes. Coelred and
Porlor were at Stillingfleet, and Hereric was
generally with them. Lilla and Bassus abode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
at Hemingborough, Forthere and Sivel at
Ulfskelf, and Godric was now at Markham,
near the banks of the Idle, his father, Ulchel,
having died. Queen Alca, in these latter
years, passed most of her time at her old
home at Aldby. She had her little child
Oswald, and the charge of Osric the Atheling,
both future kings. There were also several
sons of Ethelfrid, fine little fellows, to whom
she was very kind&mdash;Eanfrid, Oslac, Oswudu,
Oslaf, and Offa, who adored her, and a little
child named Oswy, recently born to Ethelfrith,
but who was not her son. The King was
almost always near the northern frontier of
his dominions, making raids into the country
of the Picts.</p>

<p>The friends often met at their respective
homes, and discussed schemes for the benefit
of their countrymen, who under their auspices
were making considerable advances in many
ways. But they always remembered the broad
lines of conduct laid down by Porlor at Canterbury,
and the friends frequently met to hold
consultations. Coelred and Porlor having
ascertained from Alca that, after investigation,
she was convinced that Coifi was not guilty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the matter of her father's death, received their
old friend, who was now too great a man to
act as gleeman at their feasts. His was not
an estimable character. He asked innumerable
questions, but the friends were not inclined
to be communicative. He had to go on praying
to his own gods, who never gave him
inspirations, nor even made his spells work
with effect.</p>

<p>Lilla's fondness for Bergliot had ripened
into love. The fearless warrior was married
to the Princess in the hall of Aldby in the
presence of the Queen. They lived at Hemingborough,
where the buildings had been enlarged
and improved, and they were soon blessed with
two sons, who were named Trondhere and
Trumhere. At the same time Osric the Atheling
married Elfleda, the daughter of Ingeld,
chief of the Hemingas. They had a son named
Oswin, destined like his father to be king in
troublous times. From childhood a devoted
friendship sprang up, and became stronger with
years, between the Atheling Oswin and the
two sons of Lilla. A year passed away, and
there were two more marriages. Godric's prophecy
came true. Hereric had really cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
his love for Braga all through his long exile.
He was diffident, but when he saw Lilla boldly
seek the hand of Bergliot, he also told the
story of his love. The Atheling Hereric was
married in the hall at Aldby to Braga, the
sister of Coelred and Porlor. He tried to
persuade her to become a Christian, but she
clung to the worship of Nehalennia, her
mother's deity, and when the noble&ndash;minded
Prince saw that the subject distressed her
he desisted. They had two fair daughters,
Hereswith and Hilda. Lastly, young Godric
succeeded in winning the heart of little
Nanna, and they also were married, going
to live at Markham, near the Idle, in the
country of the Gainas. Hereric and Braga
lived at Stillingfleet with their brothers.</p>

<p>Alca became the guardian and inspiring
influence of the Coelred&ndash;<i>Gemót</i>, which now
included three wives among its members. At
first, and indeed for some years, she had conversed
little respecting the mass of information
brought to her by her friends. But after the
marriages she began to talk more on the subject,
and asked many searching questions of
Porlor and the others. One summer day they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
were all in attendance upon the Queen, under
that spreading ash tree at the foot of Garraby
Hill where she had talked to the boys so
impressively long, long ago. She then began
to speak freely about the manifold wonders
she had heard, and on the impressions they
had made on her mind. "The Son of God
has indeed risen to save sinners," she said
with conviction, "as I have believed so long,
and as the good man told you all outside the
gate of Amiens. Balder has risen, for I see
much goodness and true bravery coming back
into the world," and she looked round at her
warriors with an ineffably winning smile. "But
I cannot think that Balder and Krishna were
Christ, as the learned Guru told you, though
I believe there was some truth in what he
said. All that leads to good actions, from
belief in the beautiful story of Balder, in the
traditions about Krishna, or in the worship
of Nehalennia, my sweet Braga, is of Christ,
but it is not Christ. It is of Christ, because
our Hereric tells us that Christ is all love
and truth. By these sacred stories, in all
languages, the peoples of the world, when
they follow what is good and true in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
are led to the Son of God, and are prepared
to receive him. I think that all this is working,
but very slowly, and that some day, when
God wills it, all people will worship Christ.
We cannot hasten this event, at least not
much; but we can follow resolutely and
humbly all that is good and true and
beautiful in our own religious tales, which
is following Christ, and some day we or our
children will be called to enter into the full
light." They all listened breathlessly, but did
not speak.</p>

<p>Alca next turned to other subjects, and
spoke, among many things that she touched
upon, of the journey of the Pandus to reach
Heaven. She reverted to this legend some
days afterwards, and told them to keep the
names of Draupadi and Suparaka always
sacred in their <i>Gemót</i>. "The one is an
emblem of the experience of all of us. We
strive for higher things, but are borne down
by our besetting sin. The other is a lesson
how the humblest may find grace." Porlor
asked her what the Guru intended to convey
when he said that Suparaka was Yama.
"Yama, or Adam," she said, "was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
man, and represents humanity. I think he
intended you to understand that the faithful
dog, like human beings, had a soul to be
saved." That day she ended the conversation
by expressing thanks to the Guru. "He told
you many beautiful tales," she said. "Always
remember his kindly gift to me, and let
'Bdellium' be the watchword of your <i>Gemót</i>."</p>

<p>On another day she pleased Lilla by telling
him how fond she was of the story of the
Simùrg. "We yearn for knowledge beyond
our own experience, yet we can know little
of what happened before our birth, and nothing
of what will befall after our death. That there
should be a being, coeval with the world, who
has seen and knows all that ever happened,
and who imparts her wisdom for the good of
man, is a beautiful conception. This too is a
seeking for the Son of God, and must work
for good." Many other conversations of the
same kind were held at Aldby, sometimes in
the hall, at others under the shade of trees;
and though at first absorbed in listening to
the Queen, the friends gradually began to take
more part, making suggestions and asking
questions. All remembered these meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to the last day of their lives. The happiness
seemed too great to continue. On one of the
last evenings Coelred and Porlor asked the
Queen whether she received their cloud message.
"Yes," she said simply. "I heard the
words in my sleep, and I think it must have
been on the same day. They were&mdash;'We are
well. We have never forgotten. We will
return.'" They started with astonishment
and awe, for they had not told her. "There
are many things that we can never understand
here," she went on; "but we shall know
hereafter." Then came the far&ndash;away look they
knew so well. She rose to retire, saying, "For
me it will not be long."</p>

<p>They went home with some forebodings.
Not long afterwards, towards the end of the
year 612 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, the Queen gave birth to a
daughter, who was named Ebba. In the following
spring she was taken ill, and soon her
attendants began to despair of her life. She
said that she was dying, and sent for her friends.
All her warriors were called into the presence.
"When I die," she said to them, "Ethelfrith
will be false to his promise. He will be under
no restraint. All his evil passions will break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
loose. He will try to exterminate the house
of Deira. Swear to serve Edwin and to make
him King." They all swore. "That is good,"
she said. "When I die, go to him with the
Athelings. I think you will find him in
Mercia; perhaps at Repton. Tell him I loved
him to the end. Tell him that you are my
dearest friends, and that you will be his
servants until death. Farewell, my more
than brothers." They bowed their heads in
grief, and left the room silently.</p>

<p>On the next day Alca was sinking fast.
At the last there were present with her Lilla,
Coelred, Porlor, Hereric, Bergliot, Braga, and
Nanna. They watched her pale but beautiful
face while she slept. At noon she awoke and
smiled. She looked at them all, and then her
gaze rested on the Atheling. She said in a
scarcely audible voice, but quite clearly&mdash;"My
sweet cousin Hereric, let me be received into
the fold of Christ." He quickly performed
the rite of baptism. Soon after he finished
she passed away. Her face was indescribably
lovely in death. A veil must be passed over
the intense grief of the mourners. If immediate
action had not been necessary, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
could not have borne it. Alca slept the last
sleep at Aldby by the side of her father, Ella
the King.</p>

<p>Ethelfrith arrived two days afterwards, like
a wild man as he was, all restraint cast aside.
He roughly snatched little Oswald out of the
arms of Bergliot, and sent all his sons to Bambrough.
But he did not ask for Ebba, and
Bergliot took the Princess with her to Hemingborough.
Ethelfrith then swore that he
would exterminate the royal house of Deira.
"If Edwin is King," he shouted, "a dead
man shall soon be King." Osric and his little
son Oswin were concealed by Saebald near the
crags above Nehalennia's ford. Hereric was
in greater danger. As the eldest scion of the
house of Deira, the usurper thirsted for his
blood. He was at York. Coelred and Porlor,
with Godric, who was their guest, remained
for some days on their guard at Stillingfleet;
Lilla and Bassus were in the same attitude at
Hemingborough; Forthere and Sivel at Ulfskelf.
One evening Hereric galloped into the
court at Stillingfleet, accompanied by a single
servant, his faithful Ingebrand. He said that
an attempt had been made to seize him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
that he and Ingebrand had fought their way
through his assailants. But he believed he
was followed. He was bleeding from a slight
flesh&ndash;wound. He had determined to take
refuge for a time in Elmet. His friends tried
in vain to dissuade him. Taking a tender
farewell of Braga and his two little daughters,
he continued his flight with a strong escort of
Stillingas led by Tanwin. But he dismissed
it at the Roman road. Coelred had the rest
of his men under arms. Next day a large
body of Bernicians rode up to the gate, and
demanded, in the name of King Ethelfrith,
that Hereric should be surrendered. On receiving
a defiant refusal, they assaulted the
hedge. A fierce combat ensued, and the
superior number of the Bernicians was beginning
to tell, when they were suddenly attacked
in rear. They broke and fled, closely followed
by the Stillingas, who did execution upon
them as far as Moreby. This diversion was
caused by the return of the escort under
Tanwin.</p>

<p>Next day there was a consultation with
Lilla and Bassus. It was decided that the
wishes of Alca should be carried out to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
letter. They must seek for Edwin at Repton.
There was no reason to fear for their loved
ones. The Angles, even Ethelfrith, did not
make war upon women. The brothers opened
the "<i>uvaru</i>" by Shuprak's grave and provided
themselves with treasure. Bidding farewell
to sisters and wives, full of high hopes and
noble aspirations, Coelred, Porlor, Lilla, Bassus,
and Godric crossed the Ouse and fared
southwards into Mercia, well armed and
mounted. They sent a messenger to Forthere
and Sivel, arranging to wait for them
at Godric's home near the river Idle, in the
country of the Gainas.</p>

<p>Hereric and his escort had crossed the
Ouse, by swimming at slack tide below the
junction with the Wharfe. At the Roman
road he dismissed the Stillingas, telling Tanwin
that he would be wanted soon to defend
his master's home. The Atheling and his
servant then rode westward to the banks of
the little river Cock, a tributary of the
Wharfe, which they crossed by a bridge, consisting
of a semicircular arch, a little above
Tadcaster. Beyond, at a short distance from
its left bank, there was a range of wooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
heights where the territory of Certicus of
Elmet commenced. The range was a high
bank rather than a line of hills, and the two
fugitives made their way up it, and rode over
some level country until they came to another
bank covered with ferns and a great variety
of wild flowers. The winding little Cock beck
was again at their feet. Here the Atheling
resolved to pass the night, and his servant
made a hut of boughs for him. The place
was afterwards called Beck&ndash;heigh (Becca)&mdash;"the
hill by the stream." Next morning
Hereric sent Ingebrand, who knew the language
of the Britons, with a message to the
King of Elmet at Barwick, which was about
a mile distant. The Atheling announced his
arrival, requesting protection and hospitality.
The answer was a cordial welcome, and when
Hereric reached Barwick, he found Certicus
waiting to receive him with a crowd of
natives. His palace was a large circular hut
raised on a platform of earth, and the town
consisted of a number of smaller huts scattered
over the valley. One of these near the
King's residence was assigned to Hereric.
Certicus was a little man with a scanty white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
beard, brown complexion, and small black
eyes, which generally had a cunning, and
sometimes a malignant, expression, in spite
of his efforts to appear frank and affable to
his guest. Hereric regretted that he had not
remained at Stillingfleet. He had insisted on
the course he had taken, lest his presence
should bring trouble on his friends, and their
efforts to dissuade him had been in vain. He
now determined, on the first excuse, to take
leave of Certicus and fare southwards in fulfilment
of the wish of Alca.</p>

<p>Certicus sent meals and horns of mead to
the Atheling from his own hut. A few days
were passed in hunting. One morning Ingebrand
reported that he had seen Coifi riding
away before dawn. He had noticed a muffled
stranger near the King's residence on the
previous evening. This seemed very strange,
almost unaccountable. Hereric remembered
the suspicions of the gleeman after the death
of King Ella. He had melancholy forebodings,
without being able to assign any tangible
cause for entertaining them. So he tried to
shake them off, and went out hunting with
Ingebrand and a few natives of Elmet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
attend him. Returning tired and thirsty to
his hut late in the evening, some servants
soon brought the usual meal and the cup of
mead. The mead had a curious taste, and
soon the Prince was seized with violent pains.
"Ingebrand," he said, "my faithful friend,
the treacherous Briton has poisoned me at the
instigation of Ethelfrith. The Priest of Woden,
the plausible Coifi, was not here for nothing."
Ingebrand was devoted to his master, but,
surrounded by enemies, he knew not what to
do. There was a period of insensibility, followed
by convulsions. Hereric spoke with
difficulty. "Tell Braga," he said, "that I
entreat her to be baptized with my children.
Take my message of love to my dear friends.
Tell them to remember the words of Alca, and
to be loyal warriors of King Edwin." These
were his last words. He died in the night.
Next day the body was hastily buried, and
Ingebrand was kept a close prisoner in the
hut. But he effected his escape during the
night, and reached Ulfskelf.</p>

<p>Hereric had been foully murdered, and
in two days Ethelfrith was openly glorying
over the crime. Forthere was nearly mad with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
rage. He vowed that his avenging hand
should rid the earth of both Certicus and
Ethelfrith. But he could not bring himself
to believe in the guilt of Coifi. Forthere
and Sivel assembled all their followers and
plunged into the wilds of Elmet, killing and
destroying. They fought their way to Barwick,
whence old Certicus had fled. Here
they raised a small tumulus over the remains
of the beloved Prince, and pressed onwards in
pursuit of the murderer. At last Forthere
overtook him, resting after a long journey,
with a small escort. The old wretch then
received his deserts. His skull was cleft by
the avenger. The two loyal subjects of
Edwin then led back their followers to Ulfskelf,
bade them farewell, and fared southwards
to join their friends at the home of
Godric, taking Ingebrand with them. The
peerless Atheling was partly avenged. Next
it would be the turn of Ethelfrith to meet the
avenger of blood.</p>

<p>Coelred and his friends had scarcely crossed
the Ouse when the wild King arrived at Stillingfleet
with an overwhelming force, and
searched both the court and the various buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
for the Deiran Athelings. Edwin was
beyond his reach, but he thirsted for the blood
of the other three&mdash;Hereric, Osric, and Oswin.
He then proceeded to Hemingborough and
made a similar search in person, returning to
York to receive news from Certicus, with
whom he had long had a secret understanding,
that Hereric was in his power. None of
the ladies were ill treated, and though Ethelfrith
saw his own daughter Ebba in the arms
of Bergliot, he took no notice of her.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">EDWIN</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">In the depths of the forests of the upper Trent
valley there was a wide clearing, and, near
the river&ndash;bank, on a rising ground sloping
gently inland but abruptly towards the
bank, there was an extensive range of buildings
erected round a large court, and surrounded
by a quickset hedge. This was
Repton, the royal seat of Kearl the son of
Kinemund, King of the Mercians. Large
bodies of men and many tethered horses
were at the foot of the slope. Under the
hedge, a few paces from the gate, sat a handsome
young man about twenty&ndash;eight years of
age, with his weapons thrown down on the
grass beside him. It was evidently a time
of listlessness and peace. He was playing
with two little boys. He was making them
go through their <i>idrottir</i>, or exercises. "Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Eadfrid," said the young man, "stand up by
the side of thy tall brother Offrid." The
little lads stood like small sentries. "Mark
your distance, and pick up your clubs." This
man&oelig;uvre was also successfully performed.
"Offrid, whirl thy club; Eadfrid, raise thine
over thy head and lower slowly." The boys
went to work, looking delighted. After a
time they began playing at ball, while their
father looked on, encouraging them and laughing.
Meanwhile there was a stir among the
men at the foot of the hill, and presently
seven warriors, splendidly accoutred, walked
up towards the gate, which startled the boys
at their play. The young man rose, and, to
his astonishment, the strangers knelt down
and saluted him as their King. He told
them to rise and explain whence they came
and who they were. Coelred, Porlor, Lilla,
Bassus, Forthere, Sivel, and Godric stood
before Edwin, the son of Ella. They gave
him the message from his sister Alca, and said
that they would fight by his side until he was
restored to his throne, and serve him until
death, for his own and his sister's sake. Edwin
was a tall man, like his father and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
uncle Elfric, beautifully proportioned, with
fair curling hair, and earnest eyes, which
betokened habits of thought and reflection,
unusual in that age. He received his loyal
friends cordially, but without any strong demonstrations,
introduced them to the Mercian
King, and saw to their comfort.</p>

<p>At the first opportunity, Coelred explained
the state of affairs in greater detail, and Edwin
said it was right that he should put his
position fully before his supporters. "You
have doubtless heard," he began, "that I was
carried off by old Brand when the Bernicians
conquered my country. He took me to the
land of Gwynedd, and found shelter and a
home for me near the abode of a good old
British priest named Urien, whose son was
my playmate. The grand old warrior watched
over my helpless childhood and my youth.
But at last he began to fail and died. To
him I owe my life and all the good that is
in me." Coelred pointed to Forthere and
said, "There stands the son of Brand of
Ulfskelf." Edwin at once went up to Forthere,
embraced him, and took both his hands,
pressing them affectionately. "As my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was to thee," said Forthere, "so will I be
until death parts us."</p>

<p>Edwin proceeded with his narrative. "When
I grew to be a boy, I remembered the stories of
old Brand, and longed to be again among the
English. So I bade farewell to Urien, and to
my playmate Rhunn, his son, who was also
intended to be a priest, and went to seek my
fortune. They never tried to convert me to
their religion&mdash;the British priests never do&mdash;and
I worship the gods of my fathers. I will
not weary you with the story of my wanderings
and adventures. At last I sought protection
from the King of Mercia. He received
me, and treated me as a brother. I have
fought for him in all his wars, and he gave
me his sister Quenberga for my wife. She
died, leaving me two little sons. I am now
dependent on the will of my brother&ndash;in&ndash;law;
my horse, even my arms, are not my own. I
cannot even entertain my friends. How then
can I hope to recover my kingdom?" "We
have considered all these things," said Coelred.
"We have not come empty&ndash;handed to
be a burden to you. We have enough to equip
a bodyguard of a hundred men, well armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and mounted, with which our King may fight
his way from one end of England to the
other, and appear as a worthy son of Ella."
Edwin went round and pressed the hand of
each. "How can I express my thanks?" he
said. "By using our services as you see
best," they all replied. "But the time is not
yet ripe for the recovery of Deira."</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Edwin called his
followers together. "My brother&ndash;in&ndash;law,
King Kearl of Mercia," he said, "has granted
license to me to take a hundred men into my
service. There are tidings from Wessex that
the Britons are gathering together a great
army to overwhelm the sons of Cerdic. Let
us offer them our swords and fight for them,
while the course of events in Deira ripens for
action." The proposal was received with
acclamation. "There is one thing only that
troubles me, the care of my little sons. I
dare not leave them here," he continued, "for
if anything happened to Kearl, and his cousin,
the savage and brutal Penda, succeeded, they
would be as lambs in the jaws of a wolf."
Godric then spoke. "My King," he said,
"although I am a man of the Gainas, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
married in Deira, and came with my friends
to swear obedience to Edwin. I must return
to my home, there to prepare the way for
your march northwards at the appointed
time. Entrust your sons to my care. I will
guard them with my life. My place is strong,
my followers are true. There will be no
suspicion of their identity. They will be
safe."</p>

<p>There were several weeks of preparation.
Edwin bade a tender farewell to his little
boys, who rode away with Godric. Soon
afterwards he took leave of his brother&ndash;in&ndash;law,
and fared southwards with his six paladins,
followed by a hundred well&ndash;armed Mercian
warriors.</p>

<p>The Gewissae had acquired their still
disputed territory after a long and obstinate
struggle with the Britons. When Cerdic and
his son Cynric landed in 495 they had to
fight on the first day. In 508 there was a
great battle, in which the British king
Natan&ndash;leod was slain with 5000 men. Cerdic
did not assume the position of King of
Wessex until 519; he fought another battle
in 527, and conquered the Isle of Wight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
530. Dying in 534, Cerdic was succeeded by
his son Cynric, who fought two desperate
battles with the Britons at Old Sarum and at
Banbury, before he also died in 560. His two
sons Ceawlin and Cutha continued the struggle
with great vigour. In 571 Cutha fought the
Britons at Bedford, and captured the four
British towns of Lenbury, Aylesbury, Benson,
and Eynsham. Advancing westward, Ceawlin
took the towns of Gloucester, Cirencester,
and Bath, and in a great battle killed three
British kings named Comail, Candidan, and
Farinmeail at Derham. He fought another
battle at Frethern, taking many towns and
vast spoils, but on this occasion his brother
Cutha was slain. Ceawlin was deposed and
put to death in 593, and his successor Ceolwulf
had to fight incessantly, that the
Gewissae might hold their own. In 611
Ceolwulf was succeeded by his nephew
Kingils, or Cynegils, who, during his long
reign of thirty&ndash;one years, did much to consolidate
and extend the realm of Wessex.
He was a grandson of Cutha, the brother of
Ceawlin, who were grandsons of Cerdic. In
some way Cynegils had his faithless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
truculent son Cuichelm associated with him
in the government, and in 614 the two leaders
were collecting all their forces to the north
of the Thames, to repel a great invasion of
the Britons.</p>

<p>Edwin, with his small but effective reinforcement,
was received with great joy by
Cynegils. Under the advice of Lilla and Bassus,
the little force was formed into scouting
parties, which were of immense use in keeping
Cynegils well informed respecting the movements
and position of the enemy. The two
armies gradually approached each other at a
place called Bampton. A council was held,
and Edwin advised, at the suggestion of
Bassus, that Cuichelm, who held a separate
command, should be detached round some
woods and swampy ground to make a diversion,
while the Kings attacked the hostile
army in front. Cuichelm whispered with his
principal thegn, a fierce and savage&ndash;looking
man named Eumer, and then spoke against
the adoption of Edwin's advice. After a few
more remarks from other thegns, he refused
to move. His force was encamped on a
rising ground apart from the main army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
"At least," said Cynegils, "I shall expect
you to support me as soon as the battle
begins." "Let your new friends support
you," said Cuichelm brutally, and both he
and Eumer scowled sullenly at the strangers.
Eumer was heard to say, "Let us see if these
new friends of Cynegils can win the fight
without us. We will not help them." The
Britons were advancing rapidly, and a few
hours afterwards Cynegils led his army to
the attack. The fight was long and obstinate.
Without the aid of Cuichelm's force
the Britons had a great superiority in numbers.
Cynegils and Edwin were hard pressed.
At one time their men began to give way,
but they were gallantly rallied by the paladins
and some of the Wessex thegns, and fought
on with renewed vigour. Message after
message was sent to Cuichelm for help, but
he would not move. At length, towards
sunset, the Britons began to retreat, but it
was not until their retreat had been converted
into a rout that the recreants led their men
down and began the pursuit. It was a
desperately&ndash;contested battle, and the Britons
left 265 men dead on the field. Ethelwerd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
gives the number of slain at 2040. Edwin,
Forthere, and Bassus were wounded, the
latter severely. Old Ingebrand, who had
attached himself to Forthere since the death
of Hereric, fell fighting by his side.</p>

<p>Next day Cuichelm and Eumer came to
Cynegils to give an account of the success of
their pursuit. Edwin was present, and before
all the thegns declared them to be niddring
and unworthy companions. The King of
Deira was then assisted into his camping hut,
while Cuichelm and Eumer cast looks of malignant
hatred at the warrior they had treated
so shamefully. The wounds healed under
nature's treatment, and the patients were
nearly in a state to resume work, when the
King of Wessex paid a visit to his guest. He
seemed ashamed and deeply moved. Thanking
Edwin and his friends warmly for their
most efficient aid, he entreated them to leave
the country. "There is a plot against your life,"
he said, "and at this moment I cannot promise
either to ensure your safety or to be able
effectually to punish the guilty. If anything
evil befell my guests while they were within my
jurisdiction, I could not survive the shame."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediate departure could be the only
answer to this appeal. Edwin, with his
friends, fared northwards, wanderers and
homeless. The treasure that Coelred brought
with him was nearly spent, and it was necessary
to pay and dismiss the Mercian bodyguard.
After a long consultation, Edwin
resolved to seek protection from Redwald, the
King of East Anglia.</p>

<p>The kingdom of East Anglia had been
founded in about 495 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> by Uffa, a leader
of the English, and closely allied to the
Deirans, whose descendants were known as
Uffingas. Redwald, who was a grandson of
Uffa, had succeeded in 593. His dominions
extended over the territory included in the
counties of Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire,
and the south part of Lincolnshire. Redwald
was a sovereign of considerable capacity. He
enjoyed great influence, and after the death
of Ethelbert of Kent in 616 he was acknowledged
as Bretwalda. Redwald received
Edwin and his friends with hospitality.
They found him at a fortified grange or
country house near Sleaford, not far from the
northern frontier of his dominions; and here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
they continued to reside, sending messages to
Godric, who assured Edwin that his boys were
well, and that the Gainas and Lindisfarnas
were being persuaded to join him, when he
should advance northwards.</p>

<p>It was not long before the presence of
Edwin and the great Deiran thegns at the court
of Redwald reached the ears of Ethelfrith
the Wild. He immediately sent messengers
offering the East Anglian King a large sum
of money if he would murder Edwin. Redwald
indignantly refused. Soon afterwards a
second embassy arrived with the same result.
Then came a third embassy offering the choice
of compliance or war. Redwald hesitated.
Ethelfrith had the reputation of being the
ablest as well as the most ruthless leader
among the English, and he was very powerful.
The King of East Anglia was fond of
"hedging." In after years he had a chapel
containing an altar to Christ and another to
Woden, and he worshipped at both. He promised
to deliver Edwin up to Ethelfrith's
envoy or else to make away with him. The
interview was secret and at night, but Coelred
and Porlor had the eyes of lynxes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
service of their master. Among the Bernician
envoys they noticed one who was evidently
disguised and ill at ease. They
suspected him of being Coifi. As the envoys
went from Redwald's presence to their lodging,
the two brothers seized the man they
suspected, hurried him under a clump of
trees, and whispered "Coifi!" He trembled.
"Coifi! we know you. If a hair of our
King's head is harmed, we have sworn to
kill you. Tell us everything, or this is your
last hour." The wretch confessed all.</p>

<p>Coelred went at once to Edwin's chamber,
where he was going to bed, and told him
what was designed by his host. "If you see
fit," he said, "we will at once take you out
of this place, fighting our way if necessary,
and conduct you to Godric's home, where the
Gainas are friendly, and where you will be
safe for the time." But Edwin had lost heart,
and for the moment he was overwhelmed by
his calamities. "I thank you for your good
will," he replied, "yet I cannot do what you
propose. If I must die, let it rather be by
Redwald's hand than by that of any meaner
person." Coelred retired, in great sadness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
to seek his brother, while Edwin dressed and
sat against the outer wall of the palace. He
was overwhelmed by many thoughts, not
knowing what to do, or which way to turn.
When he had been there a long time, brooding
over his misfortunes in anguish of mind,
he saw a person approaching in the dead of
night. The stranger, coming closer, saluted
him, and asked him "why he sat there alone
and melancholy on a stone, at that time of
night, when every one else was in bed and
fast asleep?" Edwin in his turn asked,
"What is it to thee whether I spend the
night within doors or abroad?" The stranger
in reply said, "Do not think that I am
ignorant of the cause of your grief, your
watching, and sitting alone without. For I
know who you are and why you grieve, and
the evils which you fear will befall you. But
tell me what reward you will give the man
that shall deliver you out of this anguish, and
persuade Redwald neither to do you any harm
himself nor to deliver you to be murdered by
your enemies." Edwin replied, "I will give
that person all that I am able, for so singular
a favour." The stranger added, "What if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
also assure you that you shall overcome your
enemies and surpass in power not only all
your progenitors, but even all that have
reigned before you over the English nation?"
Edwin did not hesitate to promise that he
would make a suitable return to him who
should so highly oblige him. Then said the
other, "But if he who foretells that so much
good is to befall you can also give you better
advice for your life and salvation than any of
your progenitors or kindred ever heard of, do
you consent to submit to him, and to follow
his wholesome counsel?" Edwin did not
hesitate to promise that he would in all
things follow the directions of that man who
should deliver him from so many calamities
and raise him to a throne. The stranger
then laid his hand on Edwin's head, saying,
"When this sign shall be given you, remember
this present discourse that has passed between
us, and do not delay the performance of what
you now promise." It was too dark for
Edwin to make out the stranger's features,
and he disappeared in the obscurity of the
night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Coelred and Porlor had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
been idle. Porlor had found favour with the
Queen's attendants, and persuaded them to
prevail upon her to grant him an audience,
even at that late hour. He told her what he
had discovered from Coifi, and entreated her
to save her husband from the shame of perpetrating
such a disgraceful crime as was
involved in the murder or betrayal of an
honoured guest. She promised to do all in
her power, telling Porlor to await the result
without. Soon afterwards Redwald went to
the Queen's apartment. His mind was not
made up, although he had wished to satisfy
the envoys. His wife now put the matter
before him in such dark colours that there
was a violent revulsion of feeling. His face
was crimson with shame. He left her swearing
that not only was Edwin safe, but that
he would help him to gain his crown. The
Queen then sent for Porlor, and told him the
result of her interview.</p>

<p>Coelred and Porlor were overjoyed. They
hurried off in search of Edwin, and as they
came up to him, Coelred cried out, "Arise.
Go in and compose yourself to sleep without
fear, for the King's resolution is altered. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
designs to do you no harm, but rather to
assist you with his power." "Was ever man
blessed with truer friends!" cried Edwin, as
he embraced the brothers. Next day Edwin
related to Coelred his midnight interview with
the stranger, which Coelred repeated to the
other friends. Forthere greeted it with a
loud laugh, and said, "I have seen a monk
secretly prowling about, and I recognised him
as one I had known before at Monte Cassiano.
His name is Paulinus. Redwald allowed him
to come, and listened to his discourses several
times through an interpreter, but would not
permit him to appear in the daytime. The
King of the East Anglians wishes to keep on
good terms both with Woden and with Christ.
Hence this secrecy. The night bird has gone
now, and will not be seen again. But mark
my words. He is busy hatching a miracle."
And Forthere laughed again.</p>

<p>The King of the East Anglians announced
his intention of defending his guest, and, if
the gods were favourable, of restoring him to
his crown. But he said that Ethelfrith was
a most formidable antagonist, and that he
would give them but little breathing&ndash;time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Redwald's fine young sons, Reynhere and
Eorpwald, were sent to bring together fighting
men as rapidly as possible. Messengers
were despatched to Godric, for Lilla and
Bassus felt that their hopes must rest on the
result of Godric's work during the last year,
and on the blunders of Ethelfrith. The news
from Godric was excellent. Saebald had
arrived at Markham with his Billingas and
with the Athelings, Osric and Oswin. Blecca,
the great thegn of Lindum, promised to join
with the Lindiswaras, and the Gainas were
stanch.</p>

<p>The Bernician envoys were dismissed with
contumely and defiance. Ethelfrith was furious,
and committed every blunder of which an
angry man could be guilty. He summoned
the Deiran thegns to York, and acted so
suspiciously, and with such insolence, that
they refused his summons to join him with
their men, and remained neutral, if not hostile.
Levies came in from Bernicia, and as soon as
he had what he considered a sufficient force,
the doomed King marched rapidly to the
south. He committed the further blunders
of despising his enemy and of taking no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
trouble to ascertain his numbers or his plans.
The wild King crossed the Don and marched
across the country of the Gainas, direct for
Sleaford.</p>

<p>"We must be satisfied with our present
force, and with the aid that Godric will bring
us, as time will not allow us to wait for
further reinforcements," said Bassus, in consultation
with the two Kings. "I know the
wild King, and he will do everything in haste.
We should advance rapidly to Godric's home
at Markham, near the river Idle. There will
the blow be struck." His advice was taken,
and in two days Redwald's army was massed
at Markham. Once more Edwin embraced
his little boys, and saw his two cousins, Osric
and Oswin, for the first time. With himself,
the house of Deira now consisted of five male
scions.</p>

<p>Lilla and Bassus laid their plans with
admirable skill, leaving nothing to chance.
The village of Markham is divided from the
river Idle by a gentle rising ground. Godric
and Blecca were placed half a mile to the
north, with the Gainas and Lindiswaras, just
below the rise, so as to be out of sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
from the river. Redwald's main army was
to begin to appear on the rise the moment
Ethelfrith reached the river&ndash;bank. This would
make him hurry his men across furiously, and
not until the last man was over was the advance
to be made. The river was to be just
in rear of the Bernicians. Scouts kept Bassus
exactly informed of the enemy's approach.
Ethelfrith despised all such precautions. Things
fell out exactly as was intended. The wild
King shouted and waved his sword when he
saw the East Anglians appearing on the crest
of the hill. They halted, and, directly the
last Bernician was across, Redwald and Edwin
advanced resolutely to the attack. Godric
alone was visible on the sky&ndash;line to the north,
and the excited Ethelfrith did not notice him.
A desperate hand&ndash;to&ndash;hand combat commenced.
Forthere was in the thick of it. He saw the
Bernician King with the glittering gilded
boar on his helmet, shouting and calling on
his men. The Berserker rage possessed the
son of Brand. Furiously dealing blows to
right and left, he hewed his way to that
gilded boar, and reached it just as Ethelfrith
killed the brave young Reynhere and brutally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
stamped on his body. The two warriors
glared at each other. Forthere was a much
younger and stronger man. "Niddring and
murderer!" he shouted, as he beat down the
wild King's guard. "That for Hereric, and
that! and that!" and he dealt him three
tremendous blows. Ethelfrith was on one
knee, and Forthere ran him through.</p>

<p>At the moment when Forthere first descried
the helmet with the gilded boar, Godric
disappeared from the sky&ndash;line. By the time
Forthere had crossed swords with Ethelfrith,
the Gainas and Lindiswaras were pouring
over the hillside and falling furiously on the
enemy's left flank. When the wild King was
seen to fall, the Bernicians tried to retreat.
The river was in their rear, a fresh enemy on
their flank. Very few prisoners were taken,
and Ethelfrith's forces were nearly annihilated.
Next morning Edwin bade farewell to Redwald
in a speech full of graceful thanks.
The voice of the East Anglian King was
broken with grief. He said, "I have opened
the road wide for you, my friend. I must
now go home to bury my dead. Farewell!"</p>

<p>Lilla urged upon Edwin that if his movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
were prompt the whole of Deira and
Bernicia could be secured as far as the Forth.
Edwin fully concurred. Not an hour must
be wasted. He thanked Godric and Blecca
warmly for their effective aid, and marched
northwards. At first his little force only consisted
of Saebald's Billingas and some Gainas
under Godric. But the march was like a
triumphal procession. By the time he reached
York the whole available force of Deira was
under his banner. There was scarcely a halt.
Osric was left in command at York to restore
order, and the King marched rapidly northwards.
At Bambrough he found that one
of the Bernician thegns had taken all the
sons of Ethelfrith and fled with them into the
country of the Picts. Edwin lamented the
loss of Oswald, his sister's son. Nearly all
the other Bernician thegns came into Bambrough
and promised obedience. He then
advanced to the shores of the Forth, the
northern frontier of his dominions. Here he
established a settlement, and built a fortress
on a high and impregnable rock. It was
called Edwins&ndash;burg (Edinburgh). When he
returned to York, Edwin was undisputed ruler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of the great united kingdom of Northumbria,
extending from the Humber to the Forth.</p>

<p>The work was not yet done. But there
were a few weeks of rest. Lilla was able to
visit his beloved Bergliot at Hemingborough,
bringing the little Atheling Oswin with him,
to be brought up with his own two sons and
the Princess Ebba. Coelred strongly advised
that a final end should be put to the independence
of Elmet, which had become a serious
nuisance. He had been at Stillingfleet, and
when he returned to the King he found that
Coifi was in prison. The friends determined
to intercede for him. They remembered the
gleeman of their boyhood, he who had taught
them the glorious song of Beowulf and all the
northern lore, they remembered that Alca had
acquitted him, and that his latest treason
was atoned for by full confession. At their
intercession Edwin contemptuously told Coifi
that he was free to return to his images at
Godmundham.</p>

<p>A large force was organised for the final
conquest of Elmet. The King invited his
cousin Braga to accompany him, to take part
in a sacred duty. There was little resistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
The Britons fled in a body towards Strathclyde,
leaving the country to be settled by the
advancing English. At Barwick&ndash;in&ndash;Elmet the
small tumulus hurriedly raised by Forthere
over the body of Hereric was found. The beloved
remains were embalmed with the frankincense
and myrrh brought from Ujjayani,
and wrapped in the precious calico and muslin.
All his companions, who had loved the Atheling
so well, stood round the body of Hereric, with
his wife Braga and his two little daughters.
There was not a dry eye in the assemblage.
King Edwin then ordered that the largest and
highest tumulus in the land should be raised
above the most noble and the most beloved
prince of his race.</p>

<p>The King resolved to extend his power from
sea to sea, and to include the Mevanian
Islands in his dominions. Scarcely any
resistance was made, and to Coelred was
entrusted the conquest of the isles, he being
the ablest and most experienced seaman in
Edwin's service. Coelred and Porlor equipped
a small but efficient fleet of armed boats at
Chester, having brought over a number of good
sailors from the Humber. Their expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
was ably conducted and was most successful.
The inhabitants of both the islands submitted,
and agreed to acknowledge King Edwin as
their lord.</p>

<p>When the sons of Seomel returned home,
there was lasting peace throughout the vast
dominions of Edwin the Great. The members
of the Coelred&ndash;<i>Gemót</i> formed the seven firm
and solid pillars which supported the edifice of
his power.</p>

<p>At first the friends had served Edwin for
his sister's sake, but they soon began to love
him for himself. His good qualities were not
on the surface. He was generous, unsuspicious,
and not vindictive. His friendships were not
quickly formed, but they were deep and lasting.
He now looked upon his seven paladins as
brothers. He was a man of rare ability and
sound judgment. He was slow to form a
decided opinion. He pondered long over what
he was told, dismissing it from his mind and
recalling it again two or three times, before he
reverted to the subject and announced his
decision. When a resolution was once taken
he acted promptly and vigorously. He soon
became devoted to his country, and placed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
good of his people before all earthly considerations;
and he was endowed with rare gifts
which enabled him to secure it. He had
common sense surely guiding him to the right
course, even when the materials for forming a
sound judgment were incomplete or inadequate.
He was far in advance of his age by reason of
his genius, and not owing to the extraordinary
accidents which raised his paladins so high
above their countrymen in knowledge and
experience. Such a man, with such marvellous
assistance, could not fail to become a great
sovereign. The friends had not poured their
experiences into his ears at once and in full
detail, as they did in the case of his sister
Alca. After much anxious consultation they
had only astonished him with a bare outline
of their stories, reserving particular points to
be explained to him in order to illustrate
discussions on measures or decisions, as the
cases arose. By this course they believed they
would be most useful in the service of their
King.</p>

<p>Aldby, his birthplace and the beloved home
of his peerless sister Alca the Queen, became the
favourite residence of King Edwin.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">BAPTISM</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Edwin, about two years after his accession,
resolved to take another wife, and he decided
upon sending an embassy to the King of Kent
to ascertain whether a proposal for a princess
of his family would be favourably entertained.
Sivel was selected for this delicate mission, and
he proceeded to Canterbury in 619, where he
was cordially received by King Eadbald, and
by his old master, Archbishop Laurentius.
He found that a number of changes had taken
place in the years that had elapsed since he
and his friends left Kent.</p>

<p>Two years after the boys set out for their
homes, Gregory sent a pall to Augustine and
a reinforcement of monks, including Mellitus,
Justus, Rufinianus, and Paulinus, with vestments
and ornaments for the church. A
letter was also sent by the Holy Father to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Augustine, exhorting him not to glory overmuch
in his miracles. They were becoming
a little too numerous. This was in 601, and
in the following year poor old Peter, having
been sent on an embassy to France, was
drowned in landing at Amfleet (Ambleteuse).
Gregory died in 605, and near the same time
Augustine had an interview with the Welsh
Bishops in Gloucestershire. It was ostensibly
on the subject of the correct way of calculating
Easter, but it was really intended to force the
native church into obedience to Rome. The
overbearing Italian expected the British clergy
to submit their judgment to his. He lost his
temper, performed one of his miracles, cursed
the British clergy, and kept seated when they
appeared&mdash;all which proceedings worked irretrievable
mischief. In 604 he ordained
Mellitus Bishop of London, where Ethelbert's
nephew Sebert, King of Essex, was willing to
receive him. At the same time Justus was
made Bishop of Rochester. In the next year
Augustine died, and was succeeded as Archbishop
of Canterbury by good old Laurentius.
Ten years afterwards Ethelbert died, after a
reign of nearly sixty years. Besides adopting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Christianity, he introduced a code of laws
after the Roman model, which was written in
English, and confirmed by the Witena&ndash;gemót
of Kent.</p>

<p>Then there was a panic among the cowardly
monks. The new King Eadbald refused to
become a Christian, and the consequence was
that the people returned to the faith of their
fathers. The monks declared that, as a sign
of divine anger, he was troubled with frequent
fits of madness and possessed of an evil spirit.
Sebert of Essex also died, and was succeeded
by profane sons. They refused baptism, but
wanted to eat the sacramental bread, and told
Mellitus that if he would not give it to them
he must leave London. These events were
looked upon as alarming by the monks of
Canterbury. They resolved to desert their
posts and run away. Mellitus and Justus
actually fled into France. Laurentius was
about to follow, but ventured first to try a
miracle. He had not been accustomed to
resort to such practices, like Augustine, but he
seems to have thought that a great occasion
justified the means. He went to Eadbald, took
off his shirt, and exposed some marks of recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
stripes on his back. The King was astonished,
and asked who had dared to treat so great a
man with such indignity. Laurentius gravely
replied that St. Peter had come down from
heaven and scourged him for his intention of
leaving England. Strange to relate, King
Eadbald believed the story, abjured the religion
of his fathers, and was baptized. Henceforward
he promoted the affairs of the Church
to the utmost of his power, and the fugitives
ventured to return.</p>

<p>Sivel gathered these particulars during his
stay at Canterbury, regretting the proceedings
of Laurentius. The King's sister was still very
young, indeed the dates point to her having
been a grand&ndash;daughter of Ethelbert. The
monks also induced Eadbald to say that it was
not lawful for a Christian virgin to marry a
Pagan king. He, however, gave Sivel to
understand that arrangements might be made
which would remove this difficulty, if there
was a similar proposal when the Princess
Ethelburga was a little older. During the
progress of the negotiations, Sivel had been
busily engaged in procuring a copy of Ethelbert's
laws, and other documents likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
useful to King Edwin in his administration.
As soon as he was ready, he took a friendly
leave of Eadbald, and visited Archbishop
Laurentius to bid him farewell. Sivel had
been grieved to hear of the miracle, and frankly
said as much. "The Prior used to resort to
those practices," he said, "but you never did."
Laurentius replied, "My son, these matters
are too high for you. Extreme measures are
sometimes needed for the safety of God's
Church." The old man was ill at ease. He
had been the instructor of Oswith and Sivel,
Coelred and Porlor on the Caelian Hill, and they
loved him. "Alas!" said Sivel, "you used to
tell us that God is truth." Laurentius bowed
his head in shame. Sivel said, "My dear old
master!" and put his hand affectionately on
the Archbishop's shoulder. "Will you take
my blessing?" asked the old man. "Thankfully,"
cried his former pupil, as he threw himself
on his knees. It was a sad leave&ndash;taking.
A month had not passed before Laurentius
was no more. He was succeeded by Mellitus,
who suffered a good deal from the gout.
It carried him off in April 624, and Justus
became Archbishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Sivel returned to York with an account of
the results of his mission, and was occupied
for the next five years in assisting and advising
Edwin concerning administrative measures of
various kinds. In 624 Edwin again sent his
trusted minister to Canterbury to ask for the
hand of Ethelburga. He was instructed to
assure Eadbald that the Princess and all her
attendants would have leave to follow their
faith and to worship after the customs of
Christians. He was even to hold out hopes
that, if Edwin was convinced that Christianity
was more holy and worthy of God than the
religion of his fathers, he might embrace the
new belief. This time no objection was made.
Eadbald promised that the Princess Ethelburga
should be sent to Edwin. But Sivel found
that Paulinus, the very man who played the
trick at Sleaford, which was exposed by Forthere,
was to accompany the bride. Paulinus
was ordained a bishop by Justus before starting,
on 21st July 625. He is described as
having been a tall man with a stooping gait,
black hair, a meagre visage, and nose slender
and aquiline. James the Deacon was also to
accompany Ethelburga, a zealous and devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
missionary, untainted with personal cowardice
or timidity, and not addicted to tricks. When
Paulinus deserted his post in the hour of
danger, James remained and braved the storm.
By the advice of Justus, the Pope Boniface IV.
wrote a letter to King Edwin urging him to
become a Christian, accompanied by a present
of a shirt with one gold ornament, and a
garment of Ancyra. Ethelburga received a
silver looking&ndash;glass and a gilt ivory comb as
papal gifts.</p>

<p>Sivel took his leave of Eadbald and rode
with all speed to Aldby to announce the success
of his mission. It was considered right
that, as Paulinus was coming as bishop, the
King should be informed by Forthere of the
trick that had been played upon him by that
holy person at Sleaford. Ethelburga came
by sea, and was met by Coelred with a fleet
of armed vessels to escort her up the Humber
and the Ouse. The King was at York, where
they were married, and then went to Aldby.
The Kentish Princess was handsome, with a
serious expression, and was very silent. She
was surnamed "Tate." She received the admonitions
and orders of Paulinus with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
humility, but at the same time she was
devoted to her husband.</p>

<p>After about a year had passed away since
the marriage, the arrival of an embassy from
Wessex was announced to Edwin. To the
general surprise, the envoy was no less a
person than Eumer, the truculent thegn who,
with Cuichelm, acted such a treacherous part
at the battle of Bampton. Edwin ordered
him to be treated with hospitality, and announced
his intention of receiving him in
audience on the following day. He supposed
that Eumer came to give some plausible
explanation of his master's conduct, and to
offer amends. The King took his seat in the
great hall at Aldby, with his thegns on either
side of him, unarmed except with the <i>seax</i>,
or long knife, worn at the girdle on the right
side. Eumer was introduced, made a low
obeisance, advanced up the hall, and came
close to the King. He put his hand into his
breast as if to draw out something to present.
Suddenly a long dagger was flashing over his
head and descending like lightning. But
devoted love is ever vigilant, and even quicker
than lightning. Lilla had flung himself between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the King's breast and the dagger. The
stroke descended with tremendous force, passed
right through Lilla, and slightly wounded
Edwin. In another instant the assassin had
turned and plunged his dagger into the body
of Forthere, who was rushing forward. The
vile wretch was then cut down, and almost
hacked to pieces.</p>

<p>Lilla and Forthere were dead, the two
brave and most loyal paladins. Never did
king have truer and more faithful servants,
never were there more constant and unchanging
friends. Bitter rage was mingled
with the intense grief of the Deirans, from the
King downwards. Lost in their prime, and
in an instant! Such sorrow as is felt by men
who have shared every hope and every joy,
almost every thought, with the lost ones
cannot be described. After the first agony
was passed, Coelred and Porlor saw most
vividly the stalwart little Oswith ready to
wrestle with them on the green at Hemingborough,
and the brave boy Forthere sinking
exhausted from running and swimming,
in the court at Stillingfleet. Then the whole
array of gallant deeds and warm&ndash;hearted
thoughts of their beloved comrades came one
after the other to their minds and overwhelmed
them with grief. Next followed a
stupor, replaced by more sad reminiscences.
The grief of Bergliot was heart&ndash;breaking, and
Sivel could not be separated from the body
of his beloved Forthere. Godric too had
lost one who had been to him more than a
brother, and Bassus was inconsolable, and
went about with a settled sternness on his
handsome features.</p><br />

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">They buried the fearless son of Guthlaf,
the bright boy Oswith, the unrivalled warrior
Lilla, in the old Roman fort at Hemingborough.
In after ages a beautiful church with a tall
spire shooting up into the sky was raised on
the spot&mdash;a fitting monument to Oswith the
fearless, chief of the Hemingas. Sivel and
Godric found a last resting&ndash;place for the body
of their beloved Forthere in the tumulus of
Vidfinn at Bilbrough.</p>

<p>On the same day, it was Easter Sunday,
the Queen gave birth to a daughter, who was
named Eanflaed. Edwin consented that she
should be baptized at Whitsuntide. Twelve
women and children of the Deiran family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
were baptized at the same time. Braga had
long felt remorse that she had not complied
with the wishes of her beloved Hereric. She
joyfully received the rite with her two
daughters Hereswith and Hilda. It also gave
Bergliot some consolation to be baptized with
her two little sons. The wife of Osric came
to the font with the young Atheling Oswin,
and Nanna with the son and heir, named
Edwin, she had borne to Godric. By the
desire of Godric, Nanna was christened by
the name of Mary, to which her husband
added the word "Audr," to denote her rare
gifts. The wife and child of a son of old
Saebald made up the twelve.</p>

<p>"Now for vengeance!" said Bassus, with
a stern inexorable look, as he stood before
the King. "Now for justice," said Edwin,
looking equally full of righteous anger. A
carefully&ndash;selected force was assembled, well
armed and supplied by the care of Coelred
and Porlor, Sivel and Godric. It was in four
divisions, one commanded by each of the
paladins, while Bassus attended the King's
person. Rapid marches were made across
Mercia, where every assistance was offered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and when the Northumbrians crossed the
Wessex frontier they began to devastate,
destroying buildings and crops, and beating
down all resistance. They had nearly reached
Sarum when a messenger arrived from Cynegils
entreating an interview. Soon the King
of Wessex arrived. He solemnly swore that
he was innocent. He declared that if Cuichelm
had not escaped and concealed himself, he
should have been given up. He assured
Edwin that he had arrested at least thirty of
Cuichelm's thegns and advisers. They were
handed over to Bassus and hanged before the
sun went down. He paid the full amount of
"were&ndash;gild" for the murdered thegns. What
more was desired of him? Edwin was appeased.
He believed Cynegils to be innocent.
The King of Wessex then fully acknowledged
the overlordship of Edwin, who returned to
York the most powerful sovereign that ever
reigned over Britain. He had been Bretwalda
since the death of Redwald in 624 over all
the other English kingdoms except Kent.</p>

<p>Edwin had long been pondering deeply
over the religion of his people, and the
question of introducing Christianity. Personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
he had ceased to believe in the gods of
his ancestors. He also felt that the old
religion was fast losing its hold on the people,
while some abiding faith was necessary for
their happiness and well&ndash;being. He conceived
that the belief in Woden and the Asyniars had
suffered a severe wrench when it was transplanted
from its native land to a new country.
It was like an uprooted tree that had been
replanted and failed to thrive. It was fast
withering. So he turned to Christianity.
Since the death of Hereric, Porlor was the
friend who was most competent to explain
its tenets, which he did to the best of his
abilities. He advised the baptism of Edwin
and the active propagation of the new religion
on very much the same grounds that
had recommended such a measure to the King.
Porlor concluded one long conversation by
saying, "Alca, thy sister, was the wisest
being this world will ever see. She also
pondered over this question&mdash;this solemn
question&mdash;for years. Her last words were,
'Hereric, my sweet cousin, bring me into the
fold of Christ.'" Edwin was deeply moved,
but he only said, "My own mind is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
up. But I think of my people, not of myself."</p>

<p>One day he was meditating deeply, after
Porlor had left him, when Paulinus entered
and came towards him with an air of mystery.
He put his right hand on the King's head
and said, in a solemn voice, "Dost thou know
that sign?" The effect was very different
from what he anticipated. Edwin sprang to
his feet with a look of scorn and contempt,
and waved him away. He said, "Here you
will always be treated with hospitality and
respect as a servant of the Queen. But when
I am baptized, it shall be by an honest man,
not by a trickster. Go!" Paulinus slunk
off, seeing that his miracle had failed to
work.</p>

<p>Edwin resolved to assemble the Witan, and
to submit the question to the great and wise
men of the kingdom. The assembly met in
the large hall of the Aldwark at York. Coelred
was selected to explain to them the tenets of
the Christian faith, which he did as nearly as
he could in the words of the beloved Hereric
when he addressed Ethelbert and his nobles at
Thanet. Edwin then asked the notables what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
they thought of the new religion. Coifi had the
assurance to speak first. He said that the old
belief had no virtue in it, for that no one had
more diligently applied himself to the worship
of the gods than he had, but they neither
inspired him nor would they make his spells
work. "Many are more preferred than I,
yet, if the gods were good for anything, they
would rather favour me, who have been more
careful to serve them. Let us receive the
new religion without any delay."</p>

<p>Then Saebald, chief of the Billingas, now a
very old man, rose and addressed Edwin. He
said, "The present life of man, O King, seems
to me, in comparison with that which is unknown
to us, like to the swift flight of a
sparrow through the room wherein you sit at
supper in winter, with your commanders and
ministers, and a good fire in the midst, whilst
the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad.
The sparrow, I say, flying in at one door and
immediately out at another, whilst he is within
is safe from the wintry storm; but after a
short space of fair weather, he immediately
vanishes out of your sight, into the dark
winter from which he had emerged. So this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
life of man appears for a short space, but of
what went before, or what is to follow, we are
utterly ignorant. If, therefore, this new
doctrine contains something more certain,
it seems justly to deserve to be followed."
The other thegns and councillors spoke,
generally to the same effect. Osric, however,
manfully maintained that the people should
not abandon the religion of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Coifi again stood up and advised that the
temples and altars they had consecrated without
reaping any benefit from them should be
set on fire. "I, who worshipped through
ignorance, will first profane the temples, as
an example to others, with the King's permission."
Edwin contemptuously, and perhaps
thoughtlessly, gave permission, for the
buffoonery of the recreant priest would cause
pain to many conscientious men. Then Coifi
mounted a stallion and set out to destroy the
idols. The people thought he was distracted.
As soon as he reached the sacred enclosure
at Godmundham, he profaned it by hurling a
spear into it, and then ordered the venerable
images and altars to be destroyed. Coifi was a
bad priest of Woden, and was not likely to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
good Christian. He had no faith. His name
appears to be Celtic, and as the priesthood was,
as a rule, looked upon as hereditary, it is
probable that he was some stray lad who had
been adopted by the "Godi" or priest. His
guardian, seeing his natural talent as a gleeman,
allowed him to pass the first half of his
life in that capacity, and Ethelric, for some
secret service, promoted him to the priesthood.
His final performance in a priestly capacity
was that of a buffoon. He was equally
dissatisfied with his new religion, and died
a year afterwards.</p>

<p>Osric was much incensed at the desecration
of the venerable images which had been
brought by his ancestors from the Continent
when they first settled in England. Coelred
and Porlor also thought that the conduct of
Coifi was contemptible, and that the things
highly valued by their fathers, if their use
had ceased, should have been put away with
becoming reverence.</p>

<p>King Edwin, with the full consent of the
Witan, had now determined to undergo the
rite of baptism. He began to build a timber
structure near the north&ndash;eastern angle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
walls of York, which was to serve as a
baptistery. When it was nearly completed
he sent for Sivel, and entrusted him with a
mission. "You remember," said the King,
"the story of my early life, how I was
befriended in Gwynedd by a Christian priest
named Urien, and that his son was my playmate.
This son was to be brought up for
the priesthood. They were true and honest
people. My Sivel, I want my playmate to
come here and to baptize me." He then
explained some topographical details bearing
on Urien's country. "It is a difficult, perhaps
a dangerous, mission, but I entrust it to you
in full confidence that it will succeed in your
hands. I and my friends shall be baptized by
an honest man, not by a trickster."</p>

<p>Sivel set out alone. His quiet manner, his
coolness, and his great experience made him
a most skilful diplomatist. He easily made
his way to Gwynedd and found his man, the
British priest Rhunn ap Urien, who readily
consented to return with him. Two months
had not elapsed before King Edwin greeted
the simple British priest who had once been
his playmate, and lodged him comfortably in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the Aldwark. On Easter Sunday of the year
627 King Edwin was baptized, in the wooden
baptistery at York, by the British priest
Rhunn ap Urien; and with the King his
two sons, most of his thegns, and a vast
number of common people also received
baptism. But Osric the Atheling refused the
rite. The baptism was an epoch in the life
and reign of Edwin the Great.</p>

<div class="break">

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">THE GREAT BRETWALDA</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Edwin had achieved the most excellent and
most difficult work that could have been
undertaken in that age. He had established
profound peace which continued until his
death. His sons Offrid and Eadfrid had grown
to be fine young men. The former was
married and had a son called Iffi, after the
King's grandfather. Ethelburga had borne
Edwin four children&mdash;Eanflaed, born on the
fatal day of the assassinations; Ethelhun and
Etheldrith, who died in infancy; and a son
named Wuscfrea, after the King's great&ndash;grandfather.
The five paladins were constantly
in attendance on Edwin, ready with
their services and advice; including Godric,
whose sons were old enough to manage his
affairs in the country of the Gainas, with the
help of his man Wiglaf. Mary Audr (Nanna)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
lived with her sister Braga at Stillingfleet, to
be near her husband. Bergliot, with her two
sons and the royal children Oswin and Ebba,
was at Hemingborough, for the wife of Osric
was dead, and he too was generally with the
King.</p>

<p>The most important matter requiring
statesmanlike treatment was the change of
religion. The baptism of the King had led
to a strong and general tendency among the
people in the same direction, but Edwin was
determined that no constraint should be used.
The choice was to be absolutely free. Rhunn
ap Urien remained, baptizing all classes, and
by his preaching many believed on Christ.
James the Deacon was a most zealous missionary,
and visited all parts of the country,
explaining the precepts of Christianity, catechising
and baptizing. He was the man whom
Edwin would have preferred as bishop. But
he found that the dismissal of Paulinus would
be painful to Ethelburga. He therefore sent
for the Roman monk, who was certainly a
zealous preacher and a man of ability. The
interview took place in the same chamber
where he had failed to dupe the King. Edwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
said to Paulinus, "Do your work zealously
as the bishop of my church. Preach and
baptize. Attend to the spiritual needs of my
household and of that of the Queen. But
remember! there must be no miracles. In
this country men are too shrewd to be treated
with such stimulants." Paulinus replied in a
becoming manner, and henceforward confined
himself to legitimate work; and Pope Honorius
sent him the pall. The Bishop of York
preached and baptized in Bernicia and in Deira,
and in the parts of Lindsey, where he converted
Blecca, thegn of the Lindiswaras, and
all his family. A man named Deda informed
the Venerable Bede that a very old man had
told him how he, with a great number of
people, was baptized in the river Trent by
Paulinus, near Southwell. Deda's informant
even described the personal appearance of the
Roman Bishop. Edwin himself persuaded
Eorpwald, who had succeeded Redwald as King
of East Anglia, to embrace Christianity with
all his people. There had been a close friendship
between them since the battle on the
Idle. There was, however, a revolt of the
party adhering to the old religion, headed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
a chief named Richbert, and King Eorpwald
was murdered. The worship of Woden again
prevailed in East Anglia for three years.
Then Sigebert, a half&ndash;brother of Eorpwald,
who had been educated in France, succeeded
in 630. The new King invited a monk from
Burgundy named Felix to assist him, and
when he was made a bishop, gave him
Dunwich for his see. Under Sigebert and
Felix the East Anglians once more became
Christians.</p>

<p>After much consultation with his paladins,
the King resolved to build a church of stone
at York to replace the wooden baptistery, and
to be dedicated to St. Peter. Edwin entrusted
the provision of materials to Coelred, and the
erection of the edifice to Sivel. The chief of
the Stillingas had organised a very efficient
fleet to patrol the Humber and its tributaries.
There must be no more kidnapping. Every
unknown boat was stopped and examined, and
the crews had to give a strict account of themselves.
A strong patrol was always maintained
at the junction of the Ouse and Wharfe.
Coelred employed some of his vessels to
convey the blocks of limestone from Calcaria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
to York, and Porlor superintended the work
at the quarries. They were near the ford of
Nehalennia, and the brothers often remembered
with affection the deity worshipped by their
gentle mother, and the memorable day when
they visited the shrine at Appleton with the
Princess Alca. Sivel was well able to design
a working plan. He built with the objects of
durability and strength, constructing his walls
by laying the stones in the herring&ndash;bone
fashion. Part of Sivel's walls may still be
seen in the crypt of York Minster. The work
progressed steadily. The King dedicated a
large gold cross and a golden chalice for the
use of his church of St. Peter at York, which
was not finished at the time of Edwin's
death.</p>

<p>The paladins of Edwin desired that as
Bretwalda of all Britain he should assume
some of the imperial state they had seen at
the court of the Emperor Maurice. Sivel
called him Basileus and Sebastos in state documents.
His banners were borne before him
when he rode about to visit all parts of his
dominions. On the occasions of his walking
along the streets a tuft of feathers fixed on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
spear, called <i>Tufa</i> by the Romans, was carried
before him. The privilege of performing
this duty belonged to Godric.</p>

<p>The King appointed a council consisting of
Coelred, Porlor, and Sivel to examine the code
of laws established by Ethelbert, to adapt
them for use in Northumbria, and to prepare
a code for submission to the national "Witan."
This assembly of notables of the kingdom was
called at regular intervals throughout the reign
of Edwin. With some alterations, they adopted
the code proposed by the King as the laws of
Northumbria. When these great men returned
to their homes they were the means of making
known the beneficent measures of the King,
and of impressing upon all men the importance
of abiding by the law and keeping the
King's peace. "It was reported that there
was then such perfect peace in Britain, wheresoever
the dominion of King Edwin extended,
that, as it is proverbially said, a woman with
her new&ndash;born babe might walk throughout the
island from sea to sea without receiving any
harm." Once Porlor related to Edwin the
story of his journey with Coelred across the
Vindhya Hills to Ujjayani in India, and described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the care of the Malwa Rajas for the
comfort of their subjects by building fountains
along the road at intervals and planting
trees. The King was much struck by Porlor's
account, and was anxious to imitate a measure
which must add so much to the convenience
of travellers. He saw the importance of encouraging
traffic and movement of all kinds.
"In several places where he had seen clear
springs near the highways he caused stakes
to be fixed with brass dishes hanging at them
for the use of passers&ndash;by; nor durst any man
touch them for any other purpose than that
for which they were designed, either through
the dread they had of the King or for the
affection which they bore him."</p>

<p>All matters relating to the currency were
naturally entrusted to Sivel, who was so well
informed respecting the working of the mint
at Antioch. In Britain it was in a deplorable
state of decadence. The Roman coins of three
metals were used long after the legions departed,
until those in circulation were quite
worn out. The expedient was then adopted
of melting the defaced money of all three
metals together, from which very small coins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
were struck called <i>stycas</i>. They may be considered
to have been worth about a shilling
of our time, with reference to buying power.
They had some letters or runes on them, but
nothing the meaning of which was intelligible,
and no king's name. Sivel began with a
reform of the <i>stycas</i>. He caused Edwin's
name as King of the English to be clearly
stamped on the obverse; his own name, as
the moneyer, with the place (<span class="smcap">eofer</span>), on the
reverse, and a cross in the centre. There was
no room for more on these minute pieces.
Sivel was also anxious to introduce a silver
penny like those of the Eastern emperors,
and he actually designed one. On the
obverse was King Edwin's head, with the
inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn center">
<span class="smcap">edvin : rex : a : bret :</span><br />
</p>

<p class="pn p1">and on the reverse a winged figure of Alca,
and the letters&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn center">
<span class="smcap">sivel : serv : alca : div :</span><br />
</p>

<p class="pn p1">Several were struck; but it was found that
the precious metals at the command of Edwin's
government were not sufficiently abundant to
bring it into circulation. Sivel had his mint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and treasury at York, and he taught several
young English lads to read and write, so as to
serve as his scribes. He recorded the events of
the reign, the measures that were adopted, and
even notes of important speeches delivered in
the Witan, such as those of Coifi and Saebald
on the occasion of the debate on the change
of religion. No one can doubt that such a
record once existed who compares the number
of anecdotes and incidents and speeches
chronicled by Bede respecting the reigns of
Edwin and his immediate successors with the
meagre lists of dates and names and battles
which is all we are told of the other kings of
the Heptarchy. Exclusive of monkish miracles
and discussions about the date of keeping
Easter, no other reign is to be compared with
that of Edwin for the amount of information
that is given by Bede. It cannot, therefore,
be disputed that the good monk of Jarrow
must have had before him either Sivel's
record or very full extracts from some such
document.</p>

<p>Edwin's favourite residence always continued
to be at Aldby, near the grave of
Alca, but the duties of administration made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
his sojourns at York very frequent. He
periodically visited all parts of his dominions.
In the far north he had a country seat called
Adgefrin on the river Glen, where the court
often remained for a month at a time.
Another country seat was at Catterick, where
the fine buildings of the Roman station of
Cataractonium were rendered fit for habitation.
Here the Deacon James eventually took
up his permanent abode. Another was at
Campodunum&mdash;the modern Tanfield, near
Ripon; another at Driffield in the Wolds.
At Barwick&ndash;in&ndash;Elmet the King sometimes
resided in a fortified house, near the lofty
tumulus erected to the memory of Hereric,
the good Atheling. On these occasions
he usually invited his cousin Braga, with
her saintly little daughters, to keep him
company.</p>

<p>Coelred and Porlor snatched occasional intervals
to rest from the cares of state with
their sisters at Stillingfleet. Good old Tanwin
had been gathered to his fathers, but
his trusty son Froda was lieutenant to the
brothers, and they intended, in the fulness of
time, that he should succeed them as leader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the Stillingas. They enjoyed the rest in the
old home and the visits to Bergliot at Hemingborough,
where they played with the sons of
their beloved Lilla, and taught them warlike
exercises. But what Coelred and Porlor loved
most in their advancing years was to sit or
recline together on the grave of Shuprak, and
talk over the past of their eventful lives.
Here they could pour out the innermost
thoughts of their hearts to each other, and
revive all the old memories. From the time
that they were little boys they had loved
Alca with a pure and holy fervour which
entirely prevented any other woman from
obtaining a place in their hearts. Now that
she was gone, the devoted, loving service was
changed into worship and a tender memory.
They were, while this life lasted, all in all to
each other. It was a very pleasant spot.
The mighty trees of the primeval forest, with
masses of ferns at their roots, overshadowed
them, while a grassy slope extended from
Shuprak's grave to the bright little beck
which babbled over rounded pebbles under
the willow trees. The quickset hedge and
the open gateway forming the boundary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the court of Stillingfleet were visible on the
crest of the opposite hill.</p>

<p>One evening, as they were reclining together
against the mound over their faithful dog, a
clap of thunder rumbled in the distance. It
reminded both of the day of the kidnapping.
For a long time neither had spoken. How
enjoyable is an occasional interval of silence
by the side of a dear friend! Coelred was the
first to speak. "I remember," he said, "when
we all dashed wildly into the forest on that
fateful day, I turned my head for a moment
and saw our mother standing in the gateway,
looking at us with her hand shading her eyes.
We were near this very spot." "Dear gentle
mother!" said Porlor, "she never saw us or
heard of us again. Yet Alca must have
cheered her last moments with her gracious
confidence that we should return." "I often
think," said Coelred, "that there is no difference
between the parting of friends on earth
and the parting by death&mdash;at least it has been
so in our case. We came back and found
father and mother and many friends cut off
by death. We left friends far away, and have
never heard of them since. To us there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
difference." "I think there is a difference,"
answered Porlor. "Sivel heard of the wicked
murder of the Emperor Maurice when he was
at Canterbury, and of the cruel slaughter of
the good General Narses by the usurper
Phocas. How gladly would we have drawn
our swords in their defence, or to avenge their
deaths! Of the rest of our far&ndash;off friends we
have heard nothing, it is true. But if we
know our friends we can make forecasts which
cannot be far wrong. We may be certain that
the dear Guru ended his days happily and
peacefully, and that death had no terror for
him. Good old Monas, after a few years of
prayer under his palm trees, passed away in
the certainty that his doctrine was the true
one, and in the undoubting belief of reward
hereafter. But I wonder what has become of
that strange young Arab, Muhammad ben
Abdallah." "No common fate," exclaimed
Coelred. "I think that he now leads the
believers in some new religion that he
has preached. Remember what old Monas
said."</p>

<p>They then talked of themselves, "And
what of ourselves?" continued Coelred. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Valkyrie have been long in choosing us. Our
turn cannot be far off now. Are we ready, my
brother?" "I believe," said Porlor, "that we
have done the work that was set before us
with all our might. That work cannot fail to
appear to ourselves, and it certainly appears
to the world, to have been of service to our
King and our countrymen. Our country has
been raised to great prosperity. Alca would
have smiled upon us. It is enough. We may
rejoice when the Valkyrie choose us." "But
this great prosperity&mdash;this happiness enjoyed
by our country&mdash;will it last?" "No," said
Porlor, "it cannot last. We must work on
until our appointed time, without comprehending
the ways of the All&ndash;father. There will
be wild kings and confusion again and again.
But of this be certain:&mdash;No good work is ever
wasted. All may appear hopeless to those
who come after us. They may think our work
was in vain. But it is not so. We have done
little. Much of our seed is cast among thorns
or by the wayside. But some few seeds have
fallen on good ground and will bear fruit for
ever. We are not unprofitable servants. Our
work is done. I feel that our time is near. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Coelred, we will die together." They wound
their arms round each other in a brotherly
embrace, as they had done under the palm
trees by the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of horse's hoofs was
heard, and Godric emerged from the forest.
He had come on a visit to Stillingfleet for a
day or two, and announced that on the third
day they were all summoned to attend the
King to Adgefrin. The days passed away
happily, and when the time came, Coelred and
Porlor bade their sisters a tender farewell.
Mounting their horses, they passed through
the well&ndash;known old gateway for the last time.</p>

<p>At the Aldwark they found the King
engaged in conversation with Bassus and Sivel.
The great general was representing to Edwin
that neither Penda nor Cadwalla was a neighbour
on whose good faith reliance could be
implicitly placed. Penda, the King of Mercia,
had succeeded in 626, not without suspicion
that he had made away with his cousin Kearl,
the late King, by violence. He was a truculent,
faithless man, always committing aggressions
on his neighbours, and ever thirsting for blood.
He had, however, freely acknowledged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Bretwaldaship of Edwin, assisted him in his
march to Wessex, and continued to profess
friendship. Bassus thought that he protested
too much. Cadwalla, the King of Gwynedd,
although professing Christianity, was a more
brutal savage than Penda. He was endowed
with some cunning, and also professed friendship
for the great Bretwalda. Bassus had
reason for suspecting that there was a secret
understanding between the two traitors. He
was no alarmist, but there had been a long
peace, and the King was unsuspicious and over&ndash;confident.
A sudden invasion would find him
unprepared. "What has happened to make
you speak thus, my Bassus?" asked the King.
The faithful paladin was unable to say that
anything had actually happened. "Ah! you
think we are rusting in the long peace. If
there should ever be war, which God forbid,"
he added affectionately, "in Bassus will be our
hope and our reliance." The other friends had
unbounded faith in the military sagacity of their
beloved companion. But Edwin would hear no
more. Bassus and Sivel remained at York.
The rest fared northward, with the King and
his family, to the royal country seat of Adgefrin.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="pn center"><span class="mid">THE END</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The day had been passed delightfully, hunting
in the forests at the bases of Cheviot Hill and
Yeavering Bell. The royal party had assembled
at a trysting&ndash;place for an early supper, and was
now riding home to Adgefrin. Edwin looked
splendid in his hunting&ndash;dress, with his golden
locks falling from a light cap, and his fair
beard resting on the darker leathern coat. He
was superbly mounted, and in one hand he
held a hunting&ndash;horn. His eyes brightened
with pride as he glanced at his gallant young
sons, Offrid and Eadfrid. Close behind him
rode Osric and his young son Oswin. Then
followed Coelred, Porlor, and Godric, with
Froda and other faithful retainers bringing up
the rear. Alas! it was the good King's last
hour of pleasure. The joyous laughter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
young Athelings rang through the glades as
the cavalcade reached home.</p>

<p>Sivel was at the gate, his face full of anxiety,
his horse covered with foam and ready to drop.
He brought certain news that Penda, the King
of Mercia, was marching across the country of
the Gainas with a large army, and had given
a defiant answer to a messenger who had been
sent to ask the cause of his invasion. In a few
days he would be on the Don. Cadwalla was
known to have an equally large force in motion,
and Bassus was sending out scouts to ascertain
his position day by day. He had also summoned
the Deiran tribes to meet at York.</p>

<p>Edwin sorrowfully remembered the timely
warning of his faithful general. Fresh horses
were ordered, and the King set out at once,
accompanied by the four paladins and his two
sons. Osric undertook to guard the Queen,
Paulinus, and the children, and to escort them
as quickly as possible to Aldby. The King
reached York in the first week of October 633.
Still worse news awaited him. Cadwalla, with
an immense army, had crossed the moors from
Chester, and was marching rapidly with the
apparent object of forming a junction with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Penda. In a hurried consultation Bassus
pointed out that every hour was of moment,
as the only hope was in engaging the two
armies in detail, before they were in touch of
each other. But the Northumbrian force was
very small, and there was no time to wait for
reinforcements. Bassus wished to attend on
the King's person, but Edwin insisted that he
must remain at York. "If anything happens
to me," he said, "who is to guard my wife and
children, who is to save the kingdom if you
fall by my side?" Bassus reluctantly yielded.
He was to strive to form a second army at
York, and guard the Queen.</p>

<p>Edwin left York with a small but valiant
force, commanded by himself in person, Coelred,
Porlor, Godric, Sivel, the two Athelings, and
the principal thegns of Deira. He felt confident
that he could dispose of Penda if he
could engage him before the arrival of Cadwalla.
All depended upon that. At the ford of
Nehalennia loyal old Saebald joined the King
with his Billingas. But news also came that
Cadwalla was already advancing down the
valley of the Calder. Edwin increased the
rapidity of his marches to the Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>Hatfield Chase was a vast extent of lake
and morass on the lower course of the Don,
overgrown with reeds and other water plants,
and dotted with islands covered with trees and
frequented by deer in great numbers. Penda
led his army across this labyrinth, from island
to island, wading and sometimes swimming.
He had just escaped from his difficulties and
drawn up the forces of Mercia on the firm land,
when the well&ndash;marshalled army of Edwin came
in sight. They passed the night facing each
other, with the camp fires of both sides visible,
and next morning they joined battle.</p>

<p>Edwin rose at dawn and called his chiefs
around him. "We must beat the Mercians,"
he said, "before our other enemies arrive, or
we are lost. It is in the hands of God. If it
is His will I will die on this field fighting for
the right. But keep the men in good heart.
Friends and brothers, never in the world's history
had king such faithful servants! Living
or dying, our hopes, our aims, are one. True
and loyal friends, we stand or fall together."
He embraced his sons, his four surviving
paladins, and the venerable Saebald, whose hair
was now white with age. He was seventy&ndash;three.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
They then all knelt down and received the
sacrament from James the Deacon, who offered
up prayers for the good men and true who
were to fight that day in a righteous cause. It
was the morning of the 14th of October 633.</p>

<p>Edwin's army was in three divisions. He
entrusted the right to Godric and Saebald,
with his son Offrid. Porlor and Eadfrid commanded
the left. The King and Coelred were
in the centre. Sivel was well mounted, and
undertook to bring news to the King from the
two wings and to carry orders. The whole
line advanced bravely to the attack, the
numbers of the two armies being about equal,
but Penda had his back to the swamps. Both
sides fought most valiantly. At last the
Mercians began to give way. Porlor had
actually driven a large body into the swamps.
The day appeared to be won. At this critical
moment Sivel galloped up to report that the
Welshmen under Cadwalla were in sight, and
rushing down upon the rear of the English
right flank in overwhelming numbers. Edwin
was obliged to order two&ndash;thirds of his force,
under Godric and Saebald, to face round and
advance to meet the Welsh. Before leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
with these orders, Coelred called Sivel aside,
and entreated him, by their sacred friendship,
to save his life. "One of us must survive," he
said. "The safety of the widows and children
will be in your keeping. My Sivel, you must
live on." They pressed each other's hands,
and Sivel galloped off with his orders.</p>

<p>Penda now saw that the force opposed to
him was so weakened that it was less than
half his own strength. He rallied his men,
and a terrible slaughter commenced. The
Deirans fell where they stood. None fled.
There was not a man who was not ready to
die for his beloved King. Porlor had closed
up from the left, and the brothers were now
fighting by the side of Edwin. At this moment
Froda arrived with the appalling news
that Godric, Saebald and his sons, and Offrid
had all been slain, and that the right wing
was falling back, overwhelmed by numbers.
"Froda, my true friend," said Coelred, "go
at speed to the Humber bank, where you will
find one of my boats. Hurry to Hemingborough
and to Stillingfleet. Tell the ladies
to fly with the children to Driffield in the
Wolds. Then speed to York and announce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the tidings to Bassus that all is lost. Remember
that, when we are dead, Froda the
son of Tanwin is chief of the Stillingas."
The young man knelt down, kissed the
hands of the King, of Coelred, and Porlor,
then galloped off in the direction of the
Humber.</p>

<p>The very thick of the fight now centred
round the King and his two paladins. Their
brave men had fallen in heaps. Not one
yielded an inch of ground. Edwin retreated
fighting until he had a bank about six feet
high, covered with tangled briers, at his back.
Here he made his last stand. He wielded his
sword like a true Viking, but at length a spear&ndash;thrust
dealt him a mortal wound. He fell.
Coelred and Porlor now stood over the body
of their King&mdash;their backs to the bank, and
half surrounded by the foe. It was not the
Berserker rage that flashed from their eyes,
yet something as terrible. It was the righteous
wrath of brave men who foresee the ruin
of a great cause. Their blows were dealt
with deadly force and with deadly skill.
Before the death&ndash;dealing strokes their assailants
recoiled and paused more than once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
In such moments the brothers clasped hands
and exchanged a few words. Then again
their swords flashed right and left with lightning
speed, dealing death around. Penda himself
had been carried away, sorely wounded.
There was a semicircle of Mercian dead round
the hero brothers, as they protected the body
of their King. Another pause. "The Valkyrie
have chosen us at last, my Porlor," said
Coelred. "They are carrying us away." "To
Christ," continued Porlor. Then they both
quoted the words of Alca spoken long ago
when they were little boys. "We fall in
battle, fighting in a righteous cause." These
were their last words. There were loud yells
and shouts, and an irresistible rush of spearmen,
for no sword could touch them. They
both fell dead across the body of the King,
which they had defended so long and so
valiantly. Their hands were clasped, their
faces turned to heaven. The battle swept
away in another direction, and there was
silence. Brambles and ivy and the straggling
branch of an overhanging yew tree, through
which the sunbeams found their way in
flickering light, shaded the mortal remains
of three heroes, three among the chief makers
of England.</p><br />

<p class="p3">"All is lost!" Froda had realised the
fears of Bassus. No hope. Few men had
come to his standard. The time was too
short. There was no choice for the Queen
but immediate flight. The three widows at
Hemingborough and Stillingfleet had escaped,
with the children, to the fortified post of
Driffield on the Wolds. Bassus hastily got
one of Coelred's finest vessels ready, and the
Queen, with the three children, Eanflaed,
Wuscfrea, and Iffi, came from Aldby. Paulinus
was at York, and said that he would
accompany the Queen to Kent. "Are you
not Bishop of York?" said Bassus with surprise.
"Is not your duty here? The Queen
is safe with me." "My duty is to accompany
the Queen," replied York's first bishop, who
wanted a safer see. "Coward!" muttered
Bassus. "He deserts at the first hint of
danger, like the monks sent by Gregory, like
Mellitus and Justus when they ran away from
Canterbury." Unknown to Bassus, Edwin's
golden chalice and cross belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
church at York were appropriated by Paulinus,
who wished to make his appearance in Kent
more acceptable by the presentation of these
treasures. Cadwalla would scarcely have
perpetrated such an act as this. So Ethelburga
and her children, and her timid
bishop, sailed for Kent under the protection
of Bassus.</p>

<p>They arrived safely in Kent, where Ethelburga
was affectionately received by her
brother King Eadbald, and she brought up
her daughter Eanflaed at Canterbury. But
she could not feel that the boys were safe
while they remained in England. She persuaded
Bassus to take Wuscfrea and Iffi to
Paris, and to put them under the protection
of her cousin King Dagobert. They both
died in infancy, and were buried with the
honours due to royal children, it is believed
at St. Denis. Bassus is supposed to have
then returned to his native country, and to
have died at Rome full of years, fondly
cherishing to the last the memory of his beloved
friend Lilla.</p>

<p>The saddest thing of all was the fate
of Edwin's two brave young sons. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
body of Offrid was never found. Eadfrid
was taken prisoner, and shortly afterwards
was basely murdered by his cousin
Penda.</p>

<p class="p2">In the second night after the battle three
lights might have been seen flickering over
the ghastly field. One came from a lantern
held by Wiglaf, Godric's man, who was
searching for the body of his master, accompanied
by the two sons of that valiant
paladin. They found it, and carried it to
his home, where it was buried amidst fruit
trees, on the site on which afterwards rose
the church of East Markham. The other two
lights were carried by Sivel and the Deacon
James. They found the precious remains
lying as they fell under the yew tree. Long
they gazed on those peerless forms. "When
will God send us their equals?" sighed Sivel.
"It must be long, alas!" assented the good
Deacon. "Perhaps in His own good time
men like them may arise again." The three
bodies were borne away to the Humber by
many loving hands, and placed in a boat.
Proceeding up the Ouse, the boat was met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
opposite to Acaster by Froda and a few surviving
Stillingas. The bodies of Coelred and
Porlor were handed over to them, and were
borne slowly to Stillingfleet, where they were
interred by the side of Shuprak on the spot
they had loved so well. The Deacon James
performed the funeral service, and afterwards
a tumulus was raised over their grave. Sivel
then went to York with the body of the
King. Bassus and Ethelburga had already
departed. The head of Edwin the Great
was interred under the porch of his unfinished
church. His body was borne to
Aldby, and buried by the side of his sister
Alca. Long afterwards it was removed to
Whitby by his grand&ndash;daughter the Abbess
Elflaed.</p>

<p>The work of Edwin and his paladins
seemed to be all undone. But it was not
so. The good seed was sown. Northumbria
flourished wonderfully for nearly a century
through the initiative given to progress by
Edwin's brilliant administration, and her
Kings were Bretwaldas of Britain. A great
calamity swept over the land, a storm beat
down the ripening grains, but they rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
again, bright and golden, and the sowers
had not lived in vain.</p>

<h2 class="p4">EPILOGUE</h2>

<p class="pn">This story will be incomplete if a concluding
narrative is not given of the subsequent
fates of the friends and relatives of King
Edwin and his paladins, of their children and
immediate descendants, as well as a brief
notice of the historian to whose laborious
zeal our knowledge of this striking episode
in our annals is due.</p>

<p>As soon as Sivel had performed his pious
duties, he took refuge at Driffield, for the
Welsh were close upon his track.</p>

<p>Penda and Cadwalla met after the slaughter.
As the former was wounded, he determined to
return to Mercia, after making a bargain for
a share of the plunder. Cadwalla dispersed
his army in large parties, moving northwards
to kill, harry, and destroy. The Welshmen
committed every conceivable atrocity: neither
age nor sex was spared, and the savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
revelled in their cruelty. Bilbrough and Ulfskelf
were sacked. Hemingborough escaped,
but of Stillingfleet not a vestige was left, and
the ancient buildings of Aldby were levelled
with the ground. Few houses escaped their
fury. Finally, they occupied York itself,
where there were new scenes of devastation
and horror.</p>

<p>Osric collected the remnant of the Deirans
at Driffield, who proclaimed him their King.
He declared that he adhered to the religion
of his ancestors, and if the wretched old
Coifi had not died soon after he polluted
the sanctuary of Woden, he would probably
have been taken to Godmundham and put
to death. After months of preparation,
Osric advanced to York, where the King of
Gwynedd still remained. The King of Deira
attacked the Decumanian Gate; but Cadwalla
sallied out with his whole army and put the
English to flight. Osric was himself among
the slain. Cadwalla then marched northwards
to subdue the Bernicians. On the
death of Edwin, the sons of Ethelfrith had
returned from their exile among the Picts,
and the eldest, Eanfrid, had been accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
as King of Bernicia. On the approach of
the ferocious Welsh King, he sued for peace,
and it was arranged that there should be
an interview. Eanfrid came to the enemy's
camp with six attendants, and was foully
murdered by Cadwalla. Eanfrid had also
adhered to the religion of his ancestors. Consequently
both these gallant young princes,
Osric and Eanfrid, are vilified and slandered
by the monks.</p>

<p>Oswald, the son of the peerless Alca, then
succeeded, and was joyfully received, both by
the Bernicians and Deirans, as their King.
He saw that there could be no terms with
the faithless Welshman&mdash;he must be stamped
out. Cadwalla was in the neighbourhood of
Hexham, near the Great Wall. When Oswald
reached a spot called Heavenfield, he put up
a cross, helping to fix it in the ground himself.
Then, raising his voice, he cried to his
army, "Let us all kneel and jointly beseech
the true and living God Almighty in His
mercy to defend us from the haughty and
fierce enemy. He knows that we have undertaken
a just war for the safety of our
nation." Advancing towards the enemy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
dawn, he gained a great victory, and Cadwalla
was killed at a place called Denisburn,
perhaps Dilston.</p>

<p>Oswald came to York, and visited the
melancholy ruins of Aldby, where his happy
childhood had been passed with his mother,
and where he had been torn from the arms
of Bergliot by the savage Ethelfrith. He
consulted with Sivel, and encouraged him to
persevere with the work of building the
church of St. Peter at York until it was
completed. Oswald applied to the monks
of Iona for a bishop, and in 635 they sent
him a devout man named Aidan, to whom
he assigned the island of Lindisfarne as his
episcopal see. "A man of singular meekness,
piety, and moderation, and zealous in
the cause of God." Oswald was acknowledged
as Bretwalda of all Britain in succession
to his uncle, Edwin the Great, and
"when raised to that height of dominion he
always continued humble, affable, and generous
to the poor and strangers." The ruthless
savage Penda had to add one more crime to
the long list before his cup was full. He
invaded Northumbria, and killed the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and saintly Oswald at the battle of Maserfield,
probably at Winwick in Lancashire, in
the year 642. Oswald's niece Osfrith,
Queen of the Mercians, translated her uncle's
bones to the Abbey of Bardney in Lincolnshire
in 697, and in 909 they were removed
into Mercia. The monks traded much with
them, as a means of working miraculous
cures.</p>

<p>Oswald was succeeded in Bernicia by his
half&ndash;brother Oswy, who had received a mother's
care from Queen Alca, though not her son.
He usurped the rights of Oswald's son Ethelwald,
the grandson of Alca. In Deira Oswin
became king in succession to his father Osric.
This excellent prince had been brought up
by Bergliot with the sons of Lilla, to whom
he was warmly attached. Trondhere, the
eldest, became his adviser and constant companion.
The younger son, Trumhere, entered
the priesthood. During the first year of
Oswin's reign the Princess Bergliot died, and
was buried by her sons, by Lilla's side, in the
old Roman fort at Hemingborough. Oswin
was a man of wonderful piety and devotion,
and governed Deira very prosperously, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
the aid of Sivel, Trondhere, and Bishop Aidan,
during seven happy and prosperous years.
He was tall and graceful, affable and always
courteous, and most generous, so that he was
beloved by all ranks of the people. He was
warmly attached to Aidan, who was astonished
at his humility, a virtue rare in kings.</p>

<p>A story was recorded by Sivel, and repeated
by Bede, which exemplifies this virtue. The
King had given Aidan an extraordinarily fine
horse, either to use in crossing rivers or in
any extraordinary emergency, for ordinarily
the Bishop travelled on foot. Soon afterwards,
meeting a beggar, Aidan dismounted
and presented the horse, with all its royal
furniture, to the miserable creature. This
was told to the King when he and the Bishop
were going in to dinner. Oswin said, "Why
did you give the beggar that royal horse
which was necessary for your use? Are there
not many other horses of less value which
would have been good enough to give to the
poor?" Aidan answered, "What is it you
say, O King? Is that foal of a mare more
dear to you than the Son of God?" Upon
this they went in to dinner, and the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
sat in his place, but the King, who had just
returned from hunting, stood warming himself,
with his attendants, at the fire. Suddenly,
calling to mind what the Bishop had said to
him, Oswin ungirt his sword, gave it to a
servant, and hastily knelt before the Bishop
asking forgiveness. Aidan was much moved,
and, starting up, raised the King, saying he
was entirely reconciled, if he would sit down
at meat and lay aside all sorrow. The King
then began to be merry. The Bishop, on
the other hand, became so melancholy as to
shed tears. His priest asked him in Gaelic
why he wept. In the same language
Aidan answered, "I weep because I know
the King will not live long. For I never
before saw so humble a king, whence I
conclude that he will soon be snatched out
of this life, for this nation is not worthy of
such a ruler."</p>

<p>It was too true. In 650 the ambitious
Oswy collected a great army to invade
Deira. Oswin assembled a smaller force, and
advanced, with Trondhere, to Catterick. But
finding that the King of Bernicia had a much
larger number of troops, he dismissed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
men to their homes to avoid useless bloodshed,
resolving to go into concealment until
better times. A certain Earl named Hunwald
promised him a safe place of retirement at
Gilling. But Hunwald was a traitor. The place
was betrayed to Oswy. On the 20th of August
650 a commander named Ethilwin and several
followers forced their way into the house.
Like his father Lilla before him, Trondhere
threw himself before his master to protect
him from the blows of the assassins. But in
vain. He was slain and thrown aside, and
then the good King Oswin was despatched.
One may hope that this was not done by
order of Oswy, and that, as in the case of
Henry II. and Becket long afterwards, he was
only guilty of a hasty word misinterpreted by
an unscrupulous servant. For some time the
crime was concealed.</p>

<p>It was not known to Sivel, who could
hardly have taken a lenient view of the
King's conduct, when bitterly resenting the
murders of the son of Lilla and of the
nephew of Hereric. But he was even then
on his death&ndash;bed. During the reign of Oswin
the last of Edwin's paladins had been chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the Billingas, but he had resigned the duties
and given up all his rights to Saebald's grandson
Osbert, whose two brothers, named Adda
and Utta, had become priests. For Sivel was
now advanced in years. He lived at York,
occupied with his chronicle, his coinage, and
the completion of King Edwin's church of St.
Peter, or York Minster. His cousin Utta
had been one of his clerks, and had since
taken orders, but continued to attend on
Sivel in his old age. At last his long and
useful course was finished, having reached his
seventy&ndash;first year, and survived all his friends.
More than two hundred years afterwards there
was a moneyer at York of the same name,
who struck coins for King Edwig, and who
may not improbably have been a descendant
of Sivel's cousin Saebald. Osbert, Adda,
and Utta conveyed the body of the last
surviving paladin of Edwin the Great from
York to Bilbrough. They buried Sivel in
the tumulus of his father Vidfinn, by the
side of his beloved Forthere. The tumulus
was then raised to nearly twice its present
height.</p>

<p>Adda became Abbot of Gateshead, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
afterwards employed in the conversion of the
Mercians. Utta was "a man of great gravity
and sincerity, and on that account honoured
by all men, even the princes of the world."
When King Oswy resolved to send an
embassy to Ercombert, King of Kent, who
had succeeded to his father Eadbald, in 641,
to ask for the hand of the daughter of Edwin
the Great, he had consulted Sivel with regard
to the selection of an ambassador, who recommended
his cousin Utta. But the mission
did not start until after the funeral of Sivel.
King Oswin, Bishop Aidan, and Sivel died
within a week of each other; and soon afterwards
the mission left York.</p>

<p>Bishop Aidan, before his death on 31st
August 650, made an excellent suggestion to
Utta. He thought it likely that a storm
would be encountered either going or returning,
and he gave Utta a keg of oil, saying that
if he threw it overboard the rough sea would
become smooth. The experiment was remarkably
successful, as Bede was told by a priest
named Cynemund, who had it from Utta
himself.</p>

<p>Eanflaed, the daughter of Edwin by Ethelburga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of Kent, arrived safely, and was married
to King Oswy, the step&ndash;son of her aunt, the
peerless Alca. She was then twenty&ndash;five
years of age. The Queen was horrified when
she heard of the murder of her cousin Oswin,
and recoiled from her husband. He appears
to have protested his innocence. Eventually
a monastery was built at Gilling, where daily
prayers were said for the soul of Oswin, and
for forgiveness to the repentant Oswy. The
first abbot was Trumhere, the younger son
of Lilla and Bergliot, and brother of the
murdered Trondhere. Born in 611, Trumhere
was a cousin of the slaughtered King, his
mother Bergliot having been a sister of
Oswin's father. He was brought up in the
same monastery with Chad, the future saint,
but not under his direction, as Bede says, for
they were contemporaries. Trumhere went
from Gilling to be the first bishop of the
Mercians, with his see at Repton. Resigning
his bishopric into the hands of King
Wulfhere, who appointed Jaruman to succeed
him, Trumhere retired to a monastery. When
a very old man, he was the instructor of the
historian Bede, and told him the anecdote of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
St. Chad, remarked upon by Jeremy Bentham
in his <i>Life of Christ</i>, touching his habit of
praying whenever there was a storm, and
the reason he gave for the practice. St.
Chad succeeded Jaruman as bishop of the
Mercians, and having transferred the see
from Repton to Lichfield, he died there in
674. Trumhere survived him for sixteen
years.</p>

<p>A few years after Oswy's marriage, his
kingdom was exposed to the desolating incursions
of the bloodthirsty King Penda of
Mercia. He did all in his power to appease
the old man. His son Egfrith was even given
up as a hostage to the Mercian Queen Cynthryth.
He offered immense gifts if Penda
would return home and cease to devastate the
country. But Penda refused them, swearing
to destroy Oswy and all his race. Oswy
became desperate. He said, "If the Pagan
will not accept our gifts, let us offer them to
Him that will, the Lord our God." He vowed
that if he was victorious he would dedicate his
youngest daughter, Elflaed, to the service of
God.</p>

<p>On 15th November 655, the two armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
met on the banks of a stream near Leeds,
which was much swollen by the rains. The
place was called Winwidfield. Penda's army
was vastly superior in numbers to the Northumbrians,
and consisted of all the power of the
Mercians, besides a contingent of East Anglians
led by their king, Ethelhard. The dethroned
son of Oswald, Etheldwald, the grandson of
Alca, was a spectator, but he did not engage
in the battle against his countrymen. Oswy
had with him his (illegitimate?) son Alchred.
After a well&ndash;contested battle, the Mercians
were forced back into the swollen water of
the flood, where there was much loss of life.
Both Penda and Ethelhard were among the
dead. There was a great slaughter, and Oswy
gained a complete victory. The unfortunate
son of Oswald is not again mentioned, and his
fate is unknown.</p>

<p>Oswy became very powerful. He was
acknowledged as Bretwalda in succession to
Oswald, and for some years he personally administered
Mercia. Afterwards Peada, the
son of Penda, having become a Christian,
was allowed to succeed, and was followed by
his brothers Wulfhere (659) and Ethelred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
(675), who married Oswy's daughter Osfrith.
Oswy must have been a man of considerable
ability. He died on 15th February 676,
leaving a son, Ealhfrith, by a first wife, and
four children by Eanflaed. These were Egfrith,
his successor; Elfwin, cut off in his youth,
which was full of promise; Osfrith, the
Mercian Queen; and Elflaed the nun&mdash;the
four grandchildren of Edwin the Great.</p>

<p class="p2">The daughters of Braga now claim our
attention. Her younger sister Nanna, or
Mary Audr, as Godric loved to call her, died
at Driffield soon after their flight thither, and
was buried by the side of her brothers. Like
her namesake, the wife of Balder, she could
not survive the death of her lord. Braga
lived on. At the time of Hereric's flight she
had a strange dream. She fancied that she
was seeking for him most carefully, and could
find no sign of him anywhere. After having
used all her industry to seek him, she found a
most precious jewel under her garment, which,
whilst she was looking at it very attentively,
cast such a light as spread itself throughout
all Britain. It was thought that this dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
was fulfilled in the life of her daughter St.
Hilda. Soon after her daughters were grown
up, Braga died, and was buried at Stillingfleet
with her sister and brothers.</p>

<p>Braga's eldest daughter, Hereswith, married
Ethelhard, King of East Anglia, who was slain
fighting for Penda at Winwidfield. Her son
Aldwulf, who succeeded, eventually became a
monk. Hereswith herself retired to the monastery
of Chelles near Paris. Hilda wished to
follow her sister, but Bishop Aidan recalled her
and induced her to lead a monastic life on some
land near the banks of the river Wear. She
was made Abbess of Heruteu (Hartlepool), and,
after some years, was removed thence to be
Abbess of Streaneshalch (Whitby), where
she was an example of good life and a person
of singular piety and grace. She also had considerable
influence in church and state; and
the famous synod, with Oswy presiding, when
Wilfrid confuted Colman in the Easter controversy,
was held in her abbey. She was a
great sufferer during the last year of her life,
and died at Whitby on 17th November 680,
aged sixty&ndash;six years. She had built another
monastery at Hackness, and at the moment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
her death one of the Hackness nuns named
Bega (St. Bees) saw her in a vision being
carried up to heaven by angels. When the
monks came next morning with the news, the
Hackness nuns told them that they had known
it for some hours. Thus died St. Hilda, the
child of Hereric and Braga.</p>

<p>Elflaed, the grandchild of King Edwin, was
entrusted to her cousin Hilda when she was at
Hartlepool, and removed with her to Whitby.
On Hilda's death, Elflaed became abbess, and,
on the death of Oswy, her mother Eanflaed
came to pass the last years of her life with her
child. They translated King Edwin's body
from Aldby to Whitby, and there they both
died and were buried. Oswy was also buried
at Whitby. The death of Elflaed took place
in 714.</p>

<p>Both the children of Alca were canonised&mdash;St.
Oswald and St. Ebba. The sweet little
Ebba was brought up by Bergliot at Hemingborough,
and early took to a religious life.
She was abbess of the monastery of Coludi,
now called Coldingham, in Berwickshire. Bede
tells us that Ebba died before 679, when the
Abbey of Coldingham was burnt down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>Egfrith, the grandson of King Edwin, succeeded
his father Oswy in 670, at the age of
eighteen, and married Etheldrida, daughter of
Anna, King of East Anglia, who preferred a
monastic life, and bore him no children.
Eventually she obtained her husband's permission
to take the veil at Coludi, where St.
Ebba, Egfrith's cousin, was abbess, whence she
removed to Ely. In 679 this king and his
brother&ndash;in&ndash;law of Mercia had an unfortunate
quarrel, and there was a battle on the banks
of the Trent, in which young Elfwin, Egfrith's
brother, was killed. He was a youth of great
promise aged eighteen, and his loss was deplored
by both sides. This made it easy for
Archbishop Theodore to offer his mediation,
and the combatants were appeased. Egfrith
was restless and ambitious. In 684 he sent
an army to invade Ireland; and the following
year he himself led a force to ravage the
country of the Picts, much against the advice
of Bishop Cuthbert and his other councillors.
He was led into an ambush at Dunnichen, on
the coast of Forfarshire, and slain on the 20th
of May 685, aged forty years, and having
reigned fifteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>Ealhfrith, a son of King Oswy, but not by
Eanflaed, succeeded his brother Egfrith, and
retrieved the ruined state of the kingdom. He
had been instructed by St. Wilfrid, and was
very learned in the Scriptures. Adamnan, the
Abbot of Iona, was ambassador at Ealhfrith's
court, and presented a book he had written on
the Holy Places to that King, who sent him
back to his country well rewarded. In 697
Osfrith, Queen of the Mercians, sister of
Egfrith and grandchild of King Edwin, was
murdered, but the circumstances are not related.
Her husband Ethelred abdicated in
704 and became a monk at Bardney, where he
died in 716. Their son Coelred succeeded his
cousin Kenred as King of Mercia in 709, and
dying in 716, he was buried at Lichfield.
Coelred survived his aunt Elflaed by two
years, and was thus the last descendant of
King Edwin.</p>

<p>King Ealhfrith of Northumbria died at
Driffield in 709, and was succeeded by his son
Osred, who was then eight years of age. When
only fifteen, he appears to have been murdered,
and a usurper named Coenred, or Kenred, seized
the government and held it for two years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
He was followed by a king named Osric, who
reigned for eleven years, when he is said to
have been slain. Then, in 731, King Ceolwulf
became ruler of Northumbria, and reigned
until 739. He was not of the family of Oswy,
but was descended directly from Ida, the first
King of Bernicia. He became a monk in 739,
leaving the kingdom to his cousin Eadbert,
whose brother was Egbert, the Archbishop of
York. This learned prelate collected a large
library, and ruled the see from 729 to 776.
Alcuin was his scholar. Eadbert, after a reign
of twenty years, also became a monk in 757,
and died in 768.</p>

<p class="p2">The Ecclesiastical History of the Venerable
Bede is the source whence nearly all the information
respecting the historical persons in
this story is derived. Bede was born during
the reign of King Egfrith in 673, in the country
between the Tyne and the Wear. Egfrith
granted a tract of land to a friend of his
named Biscop in 675, on which he founded
Wearmouth; and in 682 Biscop erected the
monastery of Jarrow on the banks of the Tyne,
and became abbot under the name of Benedict.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
This remarkable man travelled several times
to Rome, bringing back books and works of
art, masons and glaziers. Bede lived in the
monastery of Jarrow all his life, from the age
of seven. He received instruction in theology
and the Scriptures from Trumhere, the son of
Lilla and Bergliot, then very old, who thus
trained him for his future historical labours.
Bede was ordained priest in 705, during the
reign of King Ealhfrith of Northumbria, by
John, Bishop of Hexham, better known as John
of Beverley. Bede seldom left his monastery,
but he certainly paid a visit to Archbishop
Egbert at York, and was also most probably
the occasional guest of Ceolwulf, King of
Northumbria, who was a man of singular
learning and a great patron of literature. It
was Ceolwulf who requested Bede to write the
ecclesiastical history, and to whom Bede sent
the sheets for his perusal. The great historian
died on the 26th of May 735, four years
before the retirement of King Ceolwulf into a
monastery.</p>

<p>Bede wrote his history about a century
after the death of Edwin the Great. He
received his education from the son of Lilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
and derived his materials for the Northumbrian
part of his history from the chronicle of
Sivel. It was providential that such a man
should have arisen at such a juncture, gifted
with talent and ardour in the pursuit of learning,
and that the times should have been
favourable for the composition and preservation
of his work. He lived under the reigns
of enlightened Kings of Northumbria, whose
culture was due to the impetus given to progress
by Edwin and his paladins. To one of
those kings, the good Ceolwulf, he dedicated
his history. He enjoyed the friendship of the
best and most learned of the Archbishops of
York before the conquest, Egbert, the brother
of Eadbert the King. He was furnished with
materials from many quarters. But for Bede's
history, written under these favourable circumstances,
we should know nothing of the early
proceedings of the makers of England, nothing
of the story of Edwin the Great.</p>

<p>In spite of the excessive number of monkish
miracles he records, which testify to his simplicity,
and show that he was not in advance
of his contemporaries in the matter of credulity,
Bede is transparently honest. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
authorities are perfectly safe in his hands,
and he gives all his information without a
word of alteration. The confidence we may
justly repose in its author increases the
interest as well as the value of the earliest
of our histories.</p>

<p class="p2">This story is the only boy's book which Mr. Finnemore
will publish this season, and deals with a subject now of
burning interest among all boys&mdash;the scouting movement
founded by Lieut.&ndash;General Baden&ndash;Powell, C.B., the hero of
Mafeking. The story deals with the adventures of boy
scouts who formed a patrol, and above all, the doings of two
patrol&ndash;leaders who, beginning as bitter enemies, become close
friends under the influence of the boy scout movement. The
book is dedicated by special permission to General Baden&ndash;Powell,
who has been so kind as to read the story in manuscript,

<p>The hero of this thrilling story of pluck and adventure is
a young Englishman who, after a course of training at the
British Museum, is sent out by his uncle to Babylon, to
unearth a mysterious girdle, known to have been worn by
one of the ancient Assyrian Queens. Making a start from
Baghdad, young Henderson, accompanied by the Residency
Surgeon, crosses Mesopotamia, and eventually enters the
Arabian desert. Here the two friends became the guests of
a tribe of Bedouins, and, while prosecuting their search, enjoy
many strange experiences. They return to Baghdad after a
fruitless quest, and subsequently the hero returns alone to
the desert, when, with his Bedouin friends, he resumes the
pursuit of what he now discovers to be the object of the
most superstitious dread. The chase, as told, is replete with
exciting adventures, and the interest of the story is maintained
to the end. The young Englishman's indomitable determination
has its reward, and the mysteries ascribed to the
Golden Girdle are laid at rest.</p>
